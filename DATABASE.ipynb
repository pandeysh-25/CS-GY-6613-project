ROS 2 relies heavily on the division of code into packages, with each package containing a manifest file (``package.xml``). This manifest file contains essential metadata about the package, including its dependencies on other packages. This manifest is required for the meta-build tool to function. The ROS 2 build system consists of 3 major concepts. Build tool ---------- This is the software that controls the compilation and testing of a single package. In ROS 2 this is usually CMake for C++, and setuptools for Python, but other build tools are supported. Build helpers ------------- These are helper functions that hook into the build tool to developer experience. ROS 2 packages typically rely on the ``ament`` series of packages for this. ``ament`` consists of a few important repositories which are all in the . The ``ament_package`` package ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Located on |GitHub|_ at , this repository contains a single that provides various utilities for |ament packages|, e.g. templates for environment hooks. All |ament packages| must contain a single file at the root of the package regardless of their underlying build system. The \"manifest\" file contains information that is required in order to process and operate on a |package|. This |package| information includes things like the |package|\\'s name, which is globally unique, and the package\\'s dependencies. The file also serves as the marker file which indicates the location of the |package| on the file system. Parsing of the files is provided by ``catkin_pkg`` (as in ROS 1), while functionality to locate |packages| by searching the file system for these files is provided by build tools such as ``colcon``. package.xml Package manifest file which marks the root of a and contains meta information about the including its name, version, description, maintainer, license, dependencies, and more. The contents of the manifest are in machine readable XML format and the contents are described in the |REPs| and , with the possibility of further modifications in future |REPs|. So anytime some |package| is referred to as an , it means that it is a single unit of software (source code, build files, tests, documentation, and other resources) which is described using a manifest file. ament package Any |package| which contains a and follows the packaging guidelines of ``ament``, regardless of the underlying build system. Since the term is build system agnostic, there can be different kinds of |ament packages|, e.g. , , etc. Here is a list of common package types that you might run into in this software stack: CMake package Any |package| containing a plain CMake project and a manifest file. ament CMake package A that also follows the ``ament`` packaging guidelines. Python package Any |package| containing a based Python project and a manifest file. ament Python package A that also follows the ``ament`` packaging guidelines. The ``ament_cmake`` repository ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Located on |GitHub|_ at , this repository contains many \"ament CMake\" and pure CMake packages which provide the infrastructure in CMake that is required to create \"ament CMake\" packages. In this context \"ament CMake\" packages means: ``ament`` packages that are built using CMake. So the |packages| in this repository provide the necessary CMake functions/macros and CMake Modules to facilitate creating more \"ament CMake\" (or ``ament_cmake``) packages. Packages of this type are identified with the ``ament_cmake`` tag in the ```` tag of the file. The |packages| in this repository are extremely modular, but there is a single \"bottleneck\" |package| called ``ament_cmake``. Anyone can depend on the ``ament_cmake`` |package| to get all of the aggregate functionality of the |packages| in this repository. Here a list of the |packages| in the repository along with a short description: ``ament_cmake`` aggregates all other |packages| in this repository, users need only to depend on this ``ament_cmake_auto`` provides convenience CMake functions which automatically handle a lot of the tedious parts of writing a |package|\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file ``ament_cmake_core`` provides all built-in core concepts for ``ament``, e.g. environment hooks, resource indexing, symbolic linking install and others ``ament_cmake_gmock`` adds convenience functions for making gmock based unit tests ``ament_cmake_gtest`` adds convenience functions for making gtest based automated tests ``ament_cmake_nose`` adds convenience functions for making nosetests based python automated tests ``ament_cmake_python`` provides CMake functions for |packages| that contain Python code see the ``ament_cmake_test`` aggregates different kinds of tests, e.g. gtest and nosetests, under a single target using The ``ament_cmake_core`` |package| contains a lot of the CMake infrastructure that makes it possible to cleanly pass information between |packages| using conventional interfaces. This makes the |packages| have more decoupled build interfaces with other |packages|, promoting their reuse and encouraging conventions in the build systems of different |packages|. For instance, it provides a standard way to pass include directories, libraries, definitions, and dependencies between |packages| so that consumers of this information can access this information in a conventional way. The ``ament_cmake_core`` |package| also provides features of the ``ament`` build system like symbolic link installation, which allows you to symbolically link files from either the source space or the build space into the install space rather than copying them. This allows you to install once and then edit non-generated resources like Python code and configuration files without having to rerun the install step for them to take effect. This feature essentially replaces the \"devel space\" from ``catkin`` because it has most of the advantages with few of the complications or drawbacks. Another feature provided by ``ament_cmake_core`` is the |package| resource indexing which is a way for |packages| to indicate that they contain a resource of some type. The design of this feature makes it much more efficient to answer simple questions like what |packages| are in this prefix (e.g. ``/usr/local``) because it only requires that you list the files in a single possible location under that prefix. You can read more about this feature in the for the resource index. Like ``catkin``, ``ament_cmake_core`` also provides environment setup files and |package| specific environment hooks. The environment setup files, often named something like ``setup.bash``, are a place for |package| developers to define changes to the environment that are needed to utilize their |package|. The developers are able to do this using an \"environment hook\" which is basically an arbitrary bit of shell code that can set or modify environment variables, define shell functions, setup auto-completion rules, etc... This feature is how, for example, ROS 1 set the ``ROS_DISTRO`` environment variable without ``catkin`` knowing anything about the ROS distribution. The ``ament_lint`` repository ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Located on |GitHub|_ at , this repository provides several |packages| which provide linting and testing services in a convenient and consistent manner. Currently there are |packages| to support C++ style linting using ``uncrustify``, static C++ code checks using ``cppcheck``, checking for copyright in source code, Python style linting using ``pep8``, and other things. The list of helper packages will likely grow in the future. Meta-build tool --------------- This is a piece of software that knows how to topologically order a group of packages, and build or test them in the correct dependency order. This software will call into the Build Tool to do the actual work of compiling, testing, and installing the package. In ROS 2, the tool named _ is used for this.'}\n",

The ROS |client libraries| provide the user facing |APIs| that most ROS users are familiar with, and may come in a variety of programming languages. Internal API Architecture Overview ---------------------------------- There are two main internal interfaces: the ROS middleware interface (``rmw`` |API|) the ROS client library interface (``rcl`` |API|) The ``rmw`` |API| is the interface between the ROS 2 software stack and the underlying middleware implementation. The underlying middleware used for ROS 2 is either a DDS or RTPS implementation, and is responsible for discovery, publish and subscribe mechanics, request-reply mechanics for services, and serialization of message types. The ``rcl`` |API| is a slightly higher level |API| which is used to implement the |client libraries| and does not touch the middleware implementation directly, but rather does so through the ROS middleware interface (``rmw`` |API|) abstraction. ../images/ros_client_library_api_stack.png :alt: ros2 software stack As the diagram shows, these |APIs| are stacked such that the typical ROS user will use the |client library| |API|, e.g. ``rclcpp``, to implement their code (executable or library). The implementation of the |client libraries|, e.g. ``rclcpp``, use the ``rcl`` interface which provides access to the ROS graph and graph events. The ``rcl`` implementation in turn uses the ``rmw`` |API| to access the ROS graph. The purpose of the ``rcl`` implementation is to provide a common implementation for more complex ROS concepts and utilities that may be used by various |client libraries|, while remaining agnostic to the underlying middleware being used. The purpose of the ``rmw`` interface is to capture the absolute minimum middleware functionality needed to support ROS\\'s client libraries. Finally, the implementation of the ``rmw`` |API| is provided by a middleware implementation specific |package|, e.g. ``rmw_fastrtps_cpp``, the library of which is compiled against vendor specific DDS interfaces and types. In the diagram above there is also a box labeled ``ros_to_dds``, and the purpose of this box is to represent a category of possible packages which allow the user to access DDS vendor specific objects and settings using the ROS equivalents. One of the goals of this abstraction interface is to completely insulate the ROS user space code from the middleware being used, so that changing DDS vendors or even middleware technology has a minimal impact on the users code. However, we recognize that on occasion it is useful to reach into the implementation and manually adjust settings despite the consequences that might have. By requiring the use of one of these packages in order to access the underlying DDS vendor\\'s objects, we can avoid exposing vendor specific symbols and headers in the normal interface. It also makes it easy to see what code is potentially violating the vendor portability by inspecting the package\\'s dependencies to see if one of these ``ros_to_dds`` packages are being used. Type Specific Interfaces ------------------------ All along the way there are some parts of the |APIs| that are necessarily specific to the message types being exchanged, e.g. publishing a message or subscribing to a topic, and therefore require generated code for each message type. The following diagram layouts the path from user defined ``rosidl`` files, e.g. ``.msg`` files, to the type specific code used by the user and system to perform type specific functions: ../images/ros_idl_api_stack_static.png :alt: ros2 idl static type support stack Figure: flow chart of \"static\" type support generation, from ``rosidl`` files to user facing code. The right hand side of the diagram shows how the ``.msg`` files are passed directly to language specific code generators, e.g. ``rosidl_generator_cpp`` or ``rosidl_generator_py``. These generators are responsible for creating the code that the user will include (or import) and use as the in-memory representation of the messages that were defined in the ``.msg`` files. For example, consider the message ``std_msgs/String``, a user might use this file in C++ with the statement ``#include ``, or they might use the statement ``from std_msgs.msg import String`` in Python. These statements work because of the files generated by these language specific (but middleware agnostic) generator packages. Separately, the ``.msg`` files are used to generate type support code for each type. In this context, type support means: meta data or functions that are specific to a given type and that are used by the system to perform particular tasks for the given type. The type support for a given message might include things like a list of the names and types for each field in the message. It might also contain a reference to code that can perform particular tasks for that type, e.g. publish a message. Static Type Support ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ When the type support references code to do particular functions for a specific message type, that code sometimes needs to do middleware specific work. For example, consider the type specific publish function, when using \"vendor A\" the function will need to call some of \"vendor A\"\\'s |API|, but when using \"vendor B\" it will need to call \"vendor B\"\\'s |API|. To allow for middleware vendor specific code, the user defined ``.msg`` files may result in the generation of vendor specific code. This vendor specific code is still hidden from the user through the type support abstraction, which is similar to how the \"Private Implementation\" (or Pimpl) pattern works. Static Type Support with DDS ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ For middleware vendors based on DDS, and specifically those which generate code based on the OMG IDL files (``.idl`` files), the user defined ``rosidl`` files (``.msg`` files) are converted into equivalent OMG IDL files (``.idl`` files). From these OMG IDL files, vendor specific code is created and then used within the type specific functions which are referenced by the type support for a given type. The above diagram shows this on the left hand side, where the ``.msg`` files are consumed by the ``rosidl_dds`` package to produce ``.idl`` files, and then those ``.idl`` files are given to language specific and DDS vendor specific type support generation packages. For example, consider the Fast DDS implementation, which has a package called ``rosidl_typesupport_fastrtps_cpp``. This package is responsible for generating code to handle things like converting a C++ message object into a serialized octet buffer to be written over the network. This code, while specific to Fast DDS, is still not exposed to the user because of the abstraction in the type support code. Dynamic Type Support ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Another way to implement type support is to have generic functions for things like publishing to a topic, rather than generating a version of the function for each message type. In order to accomplish this, this generic function needs some meta information about the message type being published, things like a list of field names and types in the order in which they appear in the message type. Then to publish a message, you call a generic publish function and pass a message to be published along with a structure which contains the necessary meta data about the message type. This is referred to as \"dynamic\" type support, as opposed to \"static\" type support which requires generated versions of a function for each type. ../images/ros_idl_api_stack_dynamic.png :alt: ros2 idl dynamic type support stack Figure: flow chart of \"dynamic\" type support generation, from ``rosidl`` files to user facing code. The above diagram shows the flow from user defined ``rosidl`` files to generated user facing code. It is very similar to the diagram for static type support, and differs only in how the type support is generated which is represented by the left hand side of the diagram. In dynamic type support the ``.msg`` files are converted directly into user facing code. This code is also middleware agnostic, because it only contains meta information about the messages. The function to actually do the work, e.g. publishing to a topic, is generic to the message type and will make any necessary calls to the middleware specific |APIs|. Note that rather than dds vendor specific packages providing the type support code, which is the case in static type support, this method has middleware agnostic package for each language, e.g. ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_c`` and ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_cpp``. The ``introspection`` part of the package name refers to the ability to introspect any message instance with the generated meta data for the message type. This is the fundamental capability that allows for generic implementations of functions like \"publish to a topic\". This approach has the advantage that all generated code is middleware agnostic, which means it can be reused for different middleware implementations, so long as they allow for dynamic type support. It also results in less generated code, which reduces compile time and code size. However, dynamic type support requires that the underlying middleware support a similar form of dynamic type support. In the case of DDS the DDS-XTypes standard allows for publishing of messages using meta information rather than generated code. DDS-XTypes, or something like it, is required in the underlying middleware in order to support dynamic type support. Also, this approach to type support is normally slower than the static type support alternative. The type specific generated code in static type support can be written to be more efficient as it does not need to iterate over the message type\\'s meta data to perform things like serialization. The ``rcl`` repository ---------------------- The ROS Client Library interface (``rcl`` |API|) can be used by |client libraries| (e.g. ``rclc``, ``rclcpp``, ``rclpy``, etc.) in order to avoid duplicating logic and features. By reusing the ``rcl`` |API|, client libraries can be smaller and more consistent with each other. Some parts of the client library are intentionally left out of the ``rcl`` |API| because the language idiomatic method should be used to implement those parts of the system. A good example of this is the execution model, which ``rcl`` does not address at all. Instead the client library should provide a language idiomatic solution like ``pthreads`` in C, ``std::thread`` in C++11, and ``threading.Thread`` in Python. Generally the ``rcl`` interface provides functions that are not specific to a language pattern and are not specific to a particular message type. The ``rcl`` |API| is located in the repository on |GitHub|_ and contains the interface as C headers. The ``rcl`` C implementation is provided by the ``rcl`` |package| in the same repository. This implementation avoids direct contact with the middleware by instead using the ``rmw`` and ``rosidl`` |APIs|. For a complete definition of the ``rcl`` |API|, see . The ``rmw`` repository ---------------------- The ROS middleware interface (``rmw`` |API|) is the minimal set of primitive middleware capabilities needed to build ROS on top. Providers of different middleware implementations must implement this interface in order to support the entire ROS stack on top. Currently all of the middleware implementations are for different DDS vendors. The ``rmw`` |API| is located in the repository. The ``rmw`` |package| contains the C headers which define the interface, the implementation of which is provided by the various |packages| of rmw implementations for different DDS vendors. For a definition of the ``rmw`` |API|, see . The ``rosidl`` repository ------------------------- The ``rosidl`` |API| consists of a few message related static functions and types along with a definition of what code should be generated by messages in different languages. The generated message code specified in the |API| will be language specific, but may or may not reuse generated code for other languages. The generated message code specified in the |API| contains things like the message data structure, functions for construction, destruction, etc. The |API| will also implement a way to get the type support structure for the message type, which is used when publishing or subscribing to a topic of that message type. There are several repositories that play a role in the ``rosidl`` |API| and implementation. The ``rosidl`` repository, located on |GitHub|_ at , defines the message IDL syntax, i.e. syntax of ``.msg`` files, ``.srv`` files, etc., and contains |packages| for parsing the files, for providing CMake infrastructure to generate code from the messages, for generating implementation agnostic code (headers and source files), and for establishing the default set of generators. The repository contains these |packages|: ``rosidl_cmake``: provides CMake functions and modules for generating code from ``rosidl`` files, e.g. ``.msg`` files, ``.srv`` files, etc. ``rosidl_default_generators``: defines the list of default generators which ensures that they are installed as dependencies, but other injected generators can also be used. ``rosidl_generator_c``: provides tools to generate C header files (``.h``) for ``rosidl`` files. ``rosidl_generator_cpp``: provides tools to generate C++ header files (``.hpp``) for ``rosidl`` files. ``rosidl_generator_py``: provides tools to generate Python modules for ``rosidl`` files. ``rosidl_parser``: provides Python |API| for parsing ``rosidl`` files. Generators for other languages, e.g. ``rosidl_generator_java``, are hosted externally (in different repositories) but would use the same mechanism that the above generators use to \"register\" themselves as a ``rosidl`` generator. In addition to the aforementioned |packages| for parsing and generating headers for the ``rosidl`` files, the ``rosidl`` repository also contains |packages| concerned with \"type support\" for the message types defined in the files. Type support refers to the ability to interpret and manipulate the information represented by ROS message instances of particular types (publishing the messages, for example). Type support can either be provided by code that is generated at compile time or it can be done programmatically based on the contents of the ``rosidl`` file, e.g. the ``.msg`` or ``.srv`` file, and the data received, by introspecting the data. In the case of the latter, where type support is done through runtime interpretation of the messages, the message code generated by ROS 2 can be agnostic to the rmw implementation. The packages that provide this type support through introspection of the data are: ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_c``: provides tools for generating C code for supporting ``rosidl`` message data types. ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_cpp``: provides tools for generating C++ code for supporting ``rosidl`` message data types. In the case where type support is to be generated at compile time instead of being generated programmatically, a package specific to the rmw implementation will need to be used. This is because typically a particular rmw implementation will require data to be stored and manipulated in a manner that is specific to the DDS vendor in order for the DDS implementation to make use of it. See the section above for more details. For more information on what exactly is in the ``rosidl`` |API| (static and generated) see this page: The ``rcutils`` repository -------------------------- ROS 2 C Utilities (``rcutils``) is a C |API| composed of macros, functions, and data structures used throughout the ROS 2 codebase. These are mainly used for error handling, commandline argument parsing, and logging which are not specific to the client or middleware layers and can be shared by both. The ``rcutils`` |API| and implementation are located in the repository on |GitHub|_ which contains the interface as C headers. For a complete definition of the ``rcutils`` |API|, see .'}\n",

Common Packages for DDS Middleware Packages ------------------------------------------- All of the current ROS middleware implementations are based on full or partial DDS implementations. For example, there is a middleware implementation that uses RTI\\'s Connext DDS and an implementation which uses eProsima\\'s Fast DDS. Because of this, there are some shared |packages| amongst most DDS based middleware implementations. In the repository on |GitHub|_, there is the following |package|: ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl``: provides tools to generate DDS ``.idl`` files from ``rosidl`` files, e.g. ``.msg`` files, ``.srv`` files, etc. The ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl`` |package| generates a DDS ``.idl`` file for each ``rosidl`` file, e.g. ``.msg`` file, defined by |packages| containing messages. Currently DDS based ROS middleware implementations make use of this generator\\'s output ``.idl`` files to generate pre-compiled type support that is vendor specific. Structure of ROS Middleware Implementations ------------------------------------------- A ROS middleware implementation is typically made up of a few |packages| in a single repository: ``_cmake_module``: contains CMake Module for discovering and exposing required dependencies ``rmw__``: contains the implementation of the ``rmw`` |API| in a particular language, typically C++ ``rosidl_typesupport__``: contains tools to generate static type support code for ``rosidl`` files, tailored to the implementation in a particular language, typically C or C++ The ``_cmake_module`` |package| contains any CMake Modules and functions needed to find the supporting dependencies for the middleware implementation. For example, ``rti_connext_dds_cmake_module`` provides wrapper logic around the CMake Module shipped with RTI Connext DDS to make sure that all packages that depend on it will select the same installation of RTI Connext DDS. Similarly, ``fastrtps_cmake_module`` includes a CMake Module to find eProsima\\'s Fast DDS and ``gurumdds_cmake_module`` includes a CMake Module to find GurumNetworks GurumDDS. Not all implementations will have a package like this: for example, Eclipe\\'s Cyclone DDS already provides a CMake Module which is used directly by its RMW implementation without the need of additional wrappers. The ``rmw__`` |package| implements the ``rmw`` C |API| in a particular language. The implementation itself can be C++, it just must expose the header\\'s symbols as ``extern \"C\"`` so that C applications can link against it. The ``rosidl_typesupport__`` |package| provides a generator which generates DDS code in a particular language. This is done using the ``.idl`` files generated by the ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl`` |package| and the DDS IDL code generator provided by the DDS vendor. It also generates code for converting ROS message structures to and from DDS message structures. This generator is also responsible for creating a shared library for the message package it is being used in, which is specific to the messages in the message package and to the DDS vendor being used. As mentioned above, the ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_`` may be used instead of a vendor specific type support package if an rmw implementation supports runtime interpretation of messages. This ability to programmatically send and receive types over topics without generating code beforehand is achieved by supporting the . As such, rmw implementations may provide support for the X-Types standard, and/or provide a package for type support generated at compile time specific to their DDS implementation. As an example of an rmw implementation repository, the ``Eclipse Cyclone DDS`` ROS middleware implementation is on |GitHub|_ at . The rmw implementation for ``Fast DDS`` is on |GitHub|_ at . The rmw implementation for ``Connext DDS`` is on |GitHub|_ at . The rmw implementation for ``GurumDDS`` is on |GitHub|_ at .'}\n",

For instance, the high-level state machine running a robot may call an action to tell the navigation subsystem to travel to a waypoint, which may take several seconds (or minutes) to do. Along the way, the navigation subsystem can provide feedback on how far along it is, and the high-level state machine has the option to cancel or preempt the travel to that waypoint. This structure is reflected in how an action message definition looks: int32 request --- int32 response --- int32 feedback In ROS 2, actions are expected to be long running procedures, as there is overhead in setting up and monitoring the connection. If you need a short running remote procedure call, consider using a instead. Actions are identified by an action name, which looks much like a topic name (but is in a different namespace). An action consists of two parts: the action server and the action client. Action server ------------- The action server is the entity that will accept the remote procedure request and perform some procedure on it. It is also responsible for sending out feedback as the action progresses and should react to cancellation/preemption requests. For instance, consider an action to calculate the Fibonacci sequence with the following interface: int32 order --- int32[] sequence --- int32[] sequence The action server is the entity that receives this message, starts calculating the sequence up to ``order`` (providing feedback along the way), and finally returns a full result in ``sequence``. There should only ever be one action server per action name. It is undefined which action server will receive client requests in the case of multiple action servers on the same action name. Action client ------------- An action client is an entity that will request a remote action server to perform a procedure on its behalf. Following the example above, the action client is the entity that creates the initial message containing the ``order``, and waits for the action server to compute the sequence and return it (with feedback along the way). Unlike the action server, there can be arbitrary numbers of action clients using the same action name.'}\n",

Using client libraries, users gain access to ROS 2 concepts such as nodes, topics, services, etc. Client libraries come in a variety of programming languages so that users may write ROS 2 code in the language that is best-suited for their application. For example, you might prefer to write visualization tools in Python because it makes prototyping iterations faster, while for parts of your system that are concerned with efficiency, the nodes might be better implemented in C++. Nodes written using different client libraries are able to share messages with each other because all client libraries implement code generators that provide users with the capability to interact with ROS 2 interface files in the respective language. In addition to the language-specific communication tools, client libraries expose to users the core functionality that makes ROS \"ROS\". For example, here is a list of functionality that can typically be accessed through a client library: Names and namespaces Time (real or simulated) Parameters Console logging Threading model Intra-process communication Supported client libraries -------------------------- The C++ client library (``rclcpp``) and the Python client library (``rclpy``) are both client libraries which utilize common functionality in ``rcl``. The ``rclcpp`` package ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The ROS Client Library for C++ (``rclcpp``) is the user facing, C++ idiomatic interface which provides all of the ROS client functionality like creating nodes, publishers, and subscriptions. ``rclcpp`` builds on top of ``rcl`` and the ``rosidl`` |API|, and it is designed to be used with the C++ messages generated by ``rosidl_generator_cpp``. ``rclcpp`` makes use of all the features of C++ and C++17 to make the interface as easy to use as possible, but since it reuses the implementation in ``rcl`` it is able maintain a consistent behavior with the other client libraries that use the ``rcl`` |API|. The ``rclcpp`` repository is located on GitHub at and contains the |package| ``rclcpp``. The generated |API| documentation is here: The ``rclpy`` package ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The ROS Client Library for Python (``rclpy``) is the Python counterpart to the C++ client library. Like the C++ client library, ``rclpy`` also builds on top of the ``rcl`` C API for its implementation. The interface provides an idiomatic Python experience that uses native Python types and patterns like lists and context objects. By using the ``rcl`` |API| in the implementation, it stays consistent with the other client libraries in terms of feature parity and behavior. In addition to providing Python idiomatic bindings around the ``rcl`` |API| and Python classes for each message, the Python client library takes care of the execution model, using ``threading.Thread`` or similar to run the functions in the ``rcl`` |API|. Like C++ it generates custom Python code for each ROS message that the user interacts with, but unlike C++ it eventually converts the native Python message object into the C version of the message. All operations happen on the Python version of the messages until they need to be passed into the ``rcl`` layer, at which point they are converted into the plain C version of the message so it can be passed into the ``rcl`` C |API|. This is avoided if possible when communicating between publishers and subscriptions in the same process to cut down on the conversion into and out of Python. The ``rclpy`` repository is located on GitHub at and contains the |package| ``rclpy``. The generated |API| documentation is here: Community-maintained ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ While the C++ and Python client libraries are maintained by the core ROS 2 team, members of the ROS 2 community maintain additional client libraries: _ This is a set of packages (binding to ``rcl``, message generator, binding to ``tf2``, examples and tutorials) that allows the writing of Ada applications for ROS 2. _ ``rclc`` does not put a layer on top of rcl but complements rcl to make rcl+rclc a feature-complete client library in C. See _ for tutorials. _ Java and Android bindings for ROS 2. _ This is a collection of projects (bindings, code generator, examples and more) for writing ROS 2 applications for .NET Core and .NET Standard. _ rclnodejs is a Node.js client for ROS 2. It provides a simple and easy JavaScript API for ROS 2 programming. _ This is a set of projects (the rclrs client library, code generator, examples and more) that enables developers to write ROS 2 applications in Rust. _ Flutter and Dart bindings for ROS 2. Older, unmaintained client libraries are: _ _ _ Common functionality: ``rcl`` ----------------------------- Most of the functionality found in a client library is not specific to the programming language of the client library. For example, the behavior of parameters and the logic of namespaces should ideally be the same across all programming languages. Because of this, rather than implementing the common functionality from scratch, client libraries make use of a common core ROS Client Library (RCL) interface that implements logic and behavior of ROS concepts that is not language-specific. As a result, client libraries only need to wrap the common functionality in the RCL with foreign function interfaces. This keeps client libraries thinner and easier to develop. For this reason the common RCL functionality is exposed with C interfaces as the C language is typically the easiest language for client libraries to wrap. In addition to making the client libraries light-weight, an advantage of having the common core is that the behavior between languages is more consistent. If any changes are made to the logic/behavior of the functionality in the core RCL -- namespaces, for example -- all client libraries that use the RCL will have these changes reflected. Furthermore, having the common core means that maintaining multiple client libraries becomes less work when it comes to bug fixes. The API documentation for ``rcl`` can be found _. Language-specific functionality ------------------------------- Client library concepts that require language-specific features/properties are not implemented in the RCL but instead are implemented in each client library. For example, threading models used by “spin” functions will have implementations that are specific to the language of the client library. Demo ---- For a walkthrough of the message exchange between a publisher using ``rclpy`` and a subscription using ``rclcpp`` , we encourage you to watch _ starting at 17:25 (_). Comparison to ROS 1 ------------------- In ROS 1, all client libraries are developed \"from the ground up\". This allows for the ROS 1 Python client library to be implemented purely in Python, for example, which brings benefits of such as not needing to compile code. However, naming conventions and behaviors are not always consistent between client libraries, bug fixes have to be done in multiple places, and there is a lot of functionality that has only ever been implemented in one client library (e.g. UDPROS). Summary ------- By utilizing the common core ROS client library, client libraries written in a variety of programming languages are easier to write and have more consistent behavior.'}\n",

As this process purposefully does not use a centralized discovery mechanism, it can take time for ROS nodes to discover all other participants in the ROS graph. Because of this, there is a long-running daemon in the background that stores information about the ROS graph to provide faster responses to queries, e.g. the list of node names. The daemon is automatically started when the relevant command-line tools are used for the first time. You can run ``ros2 daemon --help`` for more options for interacting with the daemon. Implementation -------------- The source code for the ``ros2`` command is available at https://github.com/ros2/ros2cli. The ``ros2`` tool has been implemented as a framework that can be extended via plugins. For example, the _ package provides a ``security`` sub-command that is automatically detected by the ``ros2`` tool if the ``sros2`` package is installed.'}\n",

ROS 2 uses a simplified description language, the interface definition language (IDL), to describe these interfaces. This description makes it easy for ROS tools to automatically generate source code for the interface type in several target languages. In this document we will describe the supported types: msg: ``.msg`` files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message. They are used to generate source code for messages in different languages. srv: ``.srv`` files describe a service. They are composed of two parts: a request and a response. The request and response are message declarations. action: ``.action`` files describe actions. They are composed of three parts: a goal, a result, and feedback. Each part is a message declaration itself. Messages -------- Messages are a way for a ROS 2 node to send data on the network to other ROS nodes, with no response expected. For instance, if a ROS 2 node reads temperature data from a sensor, it can then publish that data on the ROS 2 network using a ``Temperature`` message. Other nodes on the ROS 2 network can subscribe to that data and receive the ``Temperature`` message. Messages are described and defined in ``.msg`` files in the ``msg/`` directory of a ROS package. ``.msg`` files are composed of two parts: fields and constants. Fields ^^^^^^ Each field consists of a type and a name, separated by a space, i.e: fieldtype1 fieldname1 fieldtype2 fieldname2 fieldtype3 fieldname3 For example: int32 my_int string my_string Field types ~~~~~~~~~~~ Field types can be: a built-in-type names of Message descriptions defined on their own, such as \"geometry_msgs/PoseStamped\" *Built-in-types currently supported:* :header-rows: 1 - Type name _ _ _ - bool bool builtins.bool boolean - byte uint8_t builtins.bytes* octet - char char builtins.int* char - float32 float builtins.float* float - float64 double builtins.float* double - int8 int8_t builtins.int* octet - uint8 uint8_t builtins.int* octet - int16 int16_t builtins.int* short - uint16 uint16_t builtins.int* unsigned short - int32 int32_t builtins.int* long - uint32 uint32_t builtins.int* unsigned long - int64 int64_t builtins.int* long long - uint64 uint64_t builtins.int* unsigned long long - string std::string builtins.str string - wstring std::u16string builtins.str wstring *Every built-in-type can be used to define arrays:* :header-rows: 1 - Type name _ _ _ - static array std::array builtins.list* T[N] - unbounded dynamic array std::vector builtins.list sequence - bounded dynamic array custom_class builtins.list* sequence - bounded string std::string builtins.str* string All types that are more permissive than their ROS definition enforce the ROS constraints in range and length by software. *Example of message definition using arrays and bounded types:* int32[] unbounded_integer_array int32[5] five_integers_array int32[ --- --- Like services, the request fields are before and the response fields are after the first triple-dash (``---``), respectively. There is also a third set of fields after the second triple-dash, which is the fields to be sent when sending feedback. There can be arbitrary numbers of request fields (including zero), arbitrary numbers of response fields (including zero), and arbitrary numbers of feedback fields (including zero). The ````, ````, and ```` follow all of the same rules as the ```` for a message. The ````, ````, and ```` follow all of the same rules as the ```` for a message. For instance, the ``Fibonacci`` action definition contains the following: int32 order --- int32[] sequence --- int32[] sequence This is an action definition where the action client is sending a single ``int32`` field representing the number of Fibonacci steps to take, and expecting the action server to produce an array of ``int32`` containing the complete steps. Along the way, the action server may also provide an intermediate array of ``int32`` containing the steps accomplished up until a certain point.'}\n",

Parameters are used to configure nodes at startup (and during runtime), without changing the code. The lifetime of a parameter is tied to the lifetime of the node (though the node could implement some sort of persistence to reload values after restart). Parameters are addressed by node name, node namespace, parameter name, and parameter namespace. Providing a parameter namespace is optional. Each parameter consists of a key, a value, and a descriptor. The key is a string and the value is one of the following types: ``bool``, ``int64``, ``float64``, ``string``, ``byte[]``, ``bool[]``, ``int64[]``, ``float64[]`` or ``string[]``. By default all descriptors are empty, but can contain parameter descriptions, value ranges, type information, and additional constraints. For a hands-on tutorial with ROS parameters see . Parameters background --------------------- Declaring parameters ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ By default, a node needs to *declare* all of the parameters that it will accept during its lifetime. This is so that the type and name of the parameters are well-defined at node startup time, which reduces the chances of misconfiguration later on. See or for tutorials on declaring and using parameters from a node. For some types of nodes, not all of the parameters will be known ahead of time. In these cases, the node can be instantiated with ``allow_undeclared_parameters`` set to ``true``, which will allow parameters to be get and set on the node even if they haven\\'t been declared. Parameter types ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ Each parameter on a ROS 2 node has one of the pre-defined parameter types as mentioned in the Overview. By default, attempts to change the type of a declared parameter at runtime will fail. This prevents common mistakes, such as putting a boolean value into an integer parameter. If a parameter needs to be multiple different types, and the code using the parameter can handle it, this default behavior can be changed. When the parameter is declared, it should be declared using a ``ParameterDescriptor`` with the ``dynamic_typing`` member variable set to ``true``. Parameter callbacks ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ A ROS 2 node can register three different types of callbacks to be informed when changes are happening to parameters. All three of the callbacks are optional. The first is known as a \"pre set parameter\" callback, and can be set by calling ``add_pre_set_parameters_callback`` from the node API. This callback is passed a list of the ``Parameter`` objects that are being changed, and returns nothing. When it is called, it can modify the ``Parameter`` list to change, add, or remove entries. As an example, if ``parameter2`` should change anytime that ``parameter1`` changes, that can be implemented with this callback. The second is known as a \"set parameter\" callback, and can be set by calling ``add_on_set_parameters_callback`` from the node API. The callback is passed a list of immutable ``Parameter`` objects, and returns an ``rcl_interfaces/msg/SetParametersResult``. The main purpose of this callback is to give the user the ability to inspect the upcoming change to the parameter and explicitly reject the change. It is important that \"set parameter\" callbacks have no side-effects. Since multiple \"set parameter\" callbacks can be chained, there is no way for an individual callback to know if a later callback will reject the update. If the individual callback were to make changes to the class it is in, for instance, it may get out-of-sync with the actual parameter. To get a callback *after* a parameter has been successfully changed, see the next type of callback below. The third type of callback is known as an \"post set parameter\" callback, and can be set by calling ``add_post_set_parameters_callback`` from the node API. The callback is passed a list of immutable ``Parameter`` objects, and returns nothing. The main purpose of this callback is to give the user the ability to react to changes from parameters that have successfully been accepted. The ROS 2 demos have an _ of all of these callbacks in use. Interacting with parameters --------------------------- ROS 2 nodes can perform parameter operations through node APIs as described in or . External processes can perform parameter operations via parameter services that are created by default when a node is instantiated. The services that are created by default are: ``/node_name/describe_parameters``: Uses a service type of ``rcl_interfaces/srv/DescribeParameters``. Given a list of parameter names, returns a list of descriptors associated with the parameters. ``/node_name/get_parameter_types``: Uses a service type of ``rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameterTypes``. Given a list of parameter names, returns a list of parameter types associated with the parameters. ``/node_name/get_parameters``: Uses a service type of ``rcl_interfaces/srv/GetParameters``. Given a list of parameter names, returns a list of parameter values associated with the parameters. ``/node_name/list_parameters``: Uses a service type of ``rcl_interfaces/srv/ListParameters``. Given an optional list of parameter prefixes, returns a list of the available parameters with that prefix. If the prefixes are empty, returns all parameters. ``/node_name/set_parameters``: Uses a service type of ``rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParameters``. Given a list of parameter names and values, attempts to set the parameters on the node. Returns a list of results from trying to set each parameter; some of them may have succeeded and some may have failed. ``/node_name/set_parameters_atomically``: Uses a service type of ``rcl_interfaces/srv/SetParametersAtomically``. Given a list of parameter names and values, attempts to set the parameters on the node. Returns a single result from trying to set all parameters, so if one failed, all of them failed. Setting initial parameter values when running a node ---------------------------------------------------- Initial parameter values can be set when running the node either through individual command-line arguments, or through YAML files. See for examples on how to set initial parameter values. Setting initial parameter values when launching nodes ----------------------------------------------------- Initial parameter values can also be set when running the node through the ROS 2 launch facility. See for information on how to specify parameters via launch. Manipulating parameter values at runtime ---------------------------------------- The ``ros2 param`` command is the general way to interact with parameters for nodes that are already running. ``ros2 param`` uses the parameter service API as described above to perform the various operations. See for details on how to use ``ros2 param``. Migrating from ROS 1 -------------------- The explains how to migrate ``param`` and ``rosparam`` launch tags from ROS 1 to ROS 2. The explains how to migrate parameter files from ROS 1 to ROS 2. In ROS 1, the ``roscore`` acted like a global parameter blackboard where all nodes could get and set parameters. Since there is no central ``roscore`` in ROS 2, that functionality no longer exists. The recommended approach in ROS 2 is to use per-node parameters that are closely tied to the nodes that use them. If a global blackboard is still needed, it is possible to create a dedicated node for this purpose. ROS 2 ships with one in the ``ros-{DISTRO}-demo-nodes-cpp`` package called ``parameter_blackboard``; it can be run with: ros2 run demo_nodes_cpp parameter_blackboard The code for the ``parameter_blackboard`` is _.'}\n",

In other words, a node can make a remote procedure call to another node which will do a computation and return a result. This structure is reflected in how a service message definition looks: uint32 request --- uint32 response In ROS 2, services are expected to return quickly, as the client is generally waiting on the result. Services should never be used for longer running processes, in particular processes that might need to be preempted for exceptional situations. If you have a service that will be doing a long-running computation, consider using an instead. Services are identified by a service name, which looks much like a topic name (but is in a different namespace). A service consists of two parts: the service server and the service client. Service server -------------- A service server is the entity that will accept a remote procedure request, and perform some computation on it. For instance, suppose the ROS 2 message contains the following: uint32 a uint32 b --- uint32 sum The service server would be the entity that receives this message, adds ``a`` and ``b`` together, and returns the ``sum``. There should only ever be one service server per service name. It is undefined which service server will receive client requests in the case of multiple service servers on the same service name. Service client -------------- A service client is an entity that will request a remote service server to perform a computation on its behalf. Following from the example above, the service client is the entity that creates the initial message containing ``a`` and ``b``, and waits for the service server to compute the sum and return the result. Unlike the service server, there can be arbitrary numbers of service clients using the same service name.'}\n",

Topics should be used for continuous data streams, like sensor data, robot state, etc. As stated earlier, ROS 2 is a strongly-typed, anonymous publish/subscribe system. Let\\'s break down that sentence and explain it a bit more. Publish/Subscribe ----------------- A publish/subscribe system is one in which there are producers of data (publishers) and consumers of data (subscribers). The publishers and subscribers know how to contact each other through the concept of a \"topic\", which is a common name so that the entites can find each other. For instance, when you create a publisher, you must also give it a string that is the name of the topic; the same goes for the subscriber. Any publishers and subscribers that are on the same topic name can directly communicate with each other. There may be zero or more publishers and zero or more subscribers on any particular topic. When data is published to the topic by any of the publishers, all subscribers in the system will receive the data. This system is also known as a \"bus\", since it somewhat resembles a device bus from electrical engineering. This concept of a bus is part of what makes ROS 2 a powerful and flexible system. Publishers and subscribers can come and go as needed, meaning that debugging and introspection are natural extensions to the system. For instance, if you want to record data, you can use the ``ros2 bag record`` command. Under the hood, ``ros2 bag record`` creates a new subscriber to whatever topic you tell it, without interrupting the flow of data to the other parts of the system. Anonymous --------- Another fact mentioned in the introduction is that ROS 2 is \"anonymous\". This means that when a subscriber gets a piece of data, it doesn\\'t generally know or care which publisher originally sent it (though it can find out if it wants). The benefit to this architecture is that publishers and subscribers can be swapped out at will without affecting the rest of the system. Strongly-typed -------------- Finally, the introduction also mentioned that the publish/subscribe system is \"strongly-typed\". That has two meanings in this context: 1. The types of each field in a ROS message are typed, and that type is enforced at various levels. For instance, if the ROS message contains: uint32 field1 string field2 Then the code will ensure that ``field1`` is always an unsigned integer and that ``field2`` is always a string. 2. The semantics of each field are well-defined. There is no automated mechanism to ensure this, but all of the core ROS types have strong semantics associated with them. For instance, the IMU message contains a 3-dimensional vector for the measured angular velocity, and each of the dimensions is specified to be in radians/second.

ROS 1 nodes are compiled into executables. ROS 1 nodelets on the other hand are compiled into a shared library which is then loaded at runtime by a container process. ROS 2 - Unified API ------------------- In ROS 2 the recommended way of writing your code is similar to a nodelet - we call it a ``Component``. This makes it easy to add common concepts to existing code, like a _. Having different APIs, which was the biggest drawback in ROS 1, is avoided in ROS 2 since both approaches use the same API. It is still possible to use the node-like style of \"writing your own main\" but for the common case it is not recommended. By making the process layout a deploy-time decision the user can choose between: running multiple nodes in separate processes with the benefits of process/fault isolation as well as easier debugging of individual nodes and running multiple nodes in a single process with the lower overhead and optionally more efficient communication (see ). Additionally ``ros2 launch`` can be used to automate these actions through specialized launch actions. Writing a Component ------------------- Since a component is only built into a shared library, it doesn\\'t have a ``main`` function (see _). A component is commonly a subclass of ``rclcpp::Node``. Since it is not in control of the thread, it shouldn\\'t perform any long running or blocking tasks in its constructor. Instead, it can use timers to get periodic notifications. Additionally, it can create publishers, subscriptions, servers, and clients. An important aspect of making such a class a component is that the class registers itself using macros from the package ``rclcpp_components`` (see the last line in the source code). This makes the component discoverable when its library is being loaded into a running process - it acts as kind of an entry point. Additionally, once a component is created, it must be registered with the index to be discoverable by the tooling. add_library(talker_component SHARED src/talker_component.cpp) rclcpp_components_register_nodes(talker_component \"composition::Talker\") # To register multiple components in the same shared library, use multiple calls # rclcpp_components_register_nodes(talker_component \"composition::Talker2\") For an example, In order for the component_container to be able to find desired components, it must be executed or launched from a shell that has sourced the corresponding workspace. Using Components ---------------- The _ package contains a couple of different approaches on how to use components. The three most common ones are: #. Start a (_) and call the ROS service _ offered by the container. The ROS service will then load the component specified by the passed package name and library name and start executing it within the running process. Instead of calling the ROS service programmatically you can also use a _ to invoke the ROS service with the passed command line arguments #. Create a _ containing multiple nodes which are known at compile time. This approach requires that each component has a header file (which is not strictly needed for the first case). #. Create a launch file and use ``ros2 launch`` to create a container process with multiple components loaded. Practical application --------------------- Try the .'}\n",

Tuning the build for specific core architecture (e.g. setting -mcpu=cortex-a53 -mfpu=neon-fp-armv8 when building for Raspberry Pi3). Targeting a file system other than the ones supported by the pre-built images released by Open Robotics. How does it work ? ------------------ Cross-compiling simple software (e.g. no dependencies on external libraries) is relatively simple and only requiring a cross-compiler toolchain to be used instead of the native toolchain. There are a number of factors which make this process more complex: The software being built must support the target architecture. Architecture specific code must be properly isolated and enabled during the build according to the target architecture. Examples include assembly code. All dependencies (e.g. libraries) must be present, either as pre-built or cross-compiled packages, before the target software using them is cross-compiled. When building software stacks (as opposed to standalone software) using build tools (e.g. colcon), it is expected that the build tool provides a mechanism to allow the developer to enable cross-compilation on the underlying build system used by each piece of software in the stack.

Assisted Teleop ================== **Task description** In mobile robot and autonomous vehicle navigation, there are situations where a human driver is required to intervene to get the vehicle out of a sticky situation. This can be both as a backup in case of autonomy failure as well as the primary function of the robot (e.g. telepresence robots). This project's aim is to create an assisted teleop feature in Nav2 by means of a new behavior tree configuration file (the file that defines the flow of information for the navigation task) and potentially new plugins. This feature should make sure to use the local costmap and/or sensor data in order to avoid obstacles and take position and/or velocity commands to attempt to follow. An example application of this is a telepresence robot, where a human driver is driving the robot through a space to visit in an office building or hospital. Another example would be an autonomous delivery robot stuck requiring a human driver to navigate it back into an open space for the robot to continue its task. This will be an excellent chance to make a substantial new feature in the Nav2 system to be used by hundreds of robots in the future. This project could also be a good candidate for a ROSCon talk in future events. **Project difficulty: Medium** **Project community mentor: Steve Macenski** **Mentor contact details: [See link above, link in GitHub profile description]** **Project output requirements** Integrations of an assisted teleop feature in Nav2 as either a set of plugins and/or a behavior tree configuration Robot can successfully navigate a space by a user teleop without collision If time allots, work on tuning / adding new critics to the DWB local planner to improve safety of its performance for users out of the box **Skills required** C++, XML, ROS Mobile robot navigation experience Recommended: Gazebo simulation, ROS navigation, Behavior trees **List of relevant open source software repositories and refs** **Licensing** All contributions will be under the Apache 2.0 license.

Navigation Dynamic Obstacle Integration ========================================== **Task description** The Navigation Stack has long provided robust navigation in a wide range of environments. Controllers have been developed to operate effectively in the presence of dynamic obstacles without explicitly modeling the characteristics of dynamic obstacles. However, as the field has progressed and we see more and more robots using ROS deployed in human-filled spaces, more consideration must be taken with respect to dynamic obstacles such as people, carts, animals, and vehicles. Your task will be to create integrations with existing machine learning tools that create dynamic obstacle information (ComplexYolo, Yolo3D, etc) and tie them into the navigation stack for use. It is not in the scope for you to retrain or otherwise become an expert in 3D machine learning, but some basic knowledge will be helpful. We already have a starting point in the project links below that needs to be driven to completion. This includes completing the on-going work to integrate yolact edge into this work to replace detectron2 and benchmark these capabilities on GPUs to verify sufficient run-time performance, as well as other tangental feature development. This task will involve identifying a few techniques that produce position and velocity information about dynamic obstacles that can run on a mobile robot (using high-power Intel CPU, Nvidia Jetson SoC, external GPUs, etc) and get them running with ROS and Navigation. Next, you will help create a new costmap layer to use this information to mark the dynamic obstacle in the costmap to ensure a robot does not collide with a future trajectory of an obstacle. If time permits, you may also work to also integrate this dynamic information into a path planner and/or controller to help in direct motion consideration.

It is a universal grid map library for mobile robotic mapping that can be used as the basis of environmental models and various forms of grid maps available in ROS 1. This library is one of the top downloaded ROS packages. Your task will be to work with the community and the mentor to port grid_maps metapackage from ROS 1 to ROS 2 and help develop the next generation environment model in ROS 2 to replace costmap_2d.

It is not expected to complete the full new model with sensor processing over the course of the summer.

Over the last 10 years, essentially no updates to AMCL has been made. This is due to the code base for this implementation of an Adaptive Monte Carlo Localizer is written in embedded C, not well structured, and very sensitive to changes. A-MCL implementations have been a hallmark of localization for over a decade but this particular implementation should be deprecated. Your target involves designing and creating a new localization engine for the Nav2 stack. The requirements of this are: Support 2D laser scanners Support 3D laser scanners, where 2D case could potentially be a simplified case Accurately track the localization of a robot in a given occupancy grid The reason that specific method is left open-ended is to allow for creativity, novelty, or reimplementation of a what you feel is best. We have, however, analyzed other MCL variants as being good options. This may include reimplementing an A-MCL that is designed to be modified with modular components and support sampling from a 3D lidar. Another option is a NDT-MCL using NDT 2D/3D scan matching. Other options may be proposed and discussed with mentors during the application phase. The task involves 3D as well since there is no standard 3D localizer in ROS 2 yet and more and more robust 3D SLAM libraries have emerged over the last 2 years.

Navigation Safety Node ========================= **Task description** The aim of this project is to create a safety watchdog node to ensure the robot is acting properly and not about to collide with an obstacle. Typical safety-rated lidars will contain \"safety zones\" whereas if any sensor points are located in a box around the lidar, then the lidar will send a signal to the robot to stop due to a potential collision. However, less and less people are using safety-rated lidars as consumer available lidars are dropping in cost and 3D lidars are seeing more use in mobile robotics. Your project will be to re-create this logic at the Navigation level. While this wouldn\\'t be \"safety certified\", this is a significant functional improvement on safety that could potentially safe real people from real injuries in the real-world. The project will be to create a node that sits below the navigation stack but above the robot controller to do the following: Take in the current command velocity from navigation and the most recent laser or RGBD scan Projecting the velocity forward in time ``N`` seconds, check if that velocity will result in a collision with any sensor measurements If not, allow the velocity command through to the base If it does collide, scale back the velocity such that the robot will always be at minimum ``N`` seconds from a collision Optionally if a flag is set, if ``M`` or more points are in defined bounding boxes around the robot, send only ``0`` commands to enact an emergency stop.

Reduce ROS 2 Nodes and Determinism ===================================== **Task description** This project is admittedly abstract to explain to someone unfamiliar with the inner-details of ROS 2 and its layers. If you're interested in working on this, you will become one of the few that truly understand the inner workings of it and be a very marketable skill. We do not expect anyone applying for this project to have that knowledge beforehand and we will help you learn the necessary items. ROS 2 architecturally was changed before Foxy in order to ensure that any single process containing multiple ROS 2 node objects will share the same DDS participant on the network. This is important due to the overhead that each additional DDS participant has on the system. In order for nav2 to leverage this the best, we need to adjust our usage of ROS 2 nodes and executors to further minimize the number of node objects in existence. In the early days of ROS 2 when Nav2 was being built, we were required to have many nodes in a single server in order to handle action requests and other callbacks. Now, we can make use of multi-threaded spinners, callback groups, and individual executors for specific tasks. This project will involve identifying all of the Node objects in the stack (control+F makes this easy) and work with mentors to ensure by the end of the summer each server contains only a single node. Additionally, the behavior tree plugins should be updated to leverage callback groups to ensure that any single BT node spinning to check if any new messages are on its callback will **only** trigger its own callback by the same mechanisms. More details about this project can be supplied if interested, but the tickets linked below also provide more context. Trust me to say this is a very achievable goal over the course of the summer and will also let you look under the hood of both Nav2 and rclcpp, giving you valuable insight future in your career (and put you in the top 10% of ROS 2 developers that know it to this degree). **Project difficulty: Medium** **Project community mentor: Steve Macenski** **Mentor contact details: [See link above, link in GitHub profile description]** **Project output requirements** Remove excess ROS 2 nodes from stack and replace with executors and multi-threaded executors Replace Behavior Tree node spinners with local executors to ensure deterministic execution & processing only callback groups of the current BT node If time allots, create a single ``main()`` function Nav2 executable composing all Nav2 processes and benchmarking improvements in performance **Skills required** C++, ROS **List of relevant open source software repositories and refs** **Licensing** All contributions will be under the Apache 2.0 license.

This project is one of the flagship projects along with MoveIt that acts as an applications entry point and frameworks for ROS. Navigation in ROS 2 builds on the wild success of the original Navigation Stack (Nav Stack) in ROS (1). This project has been used by researchers, educators, and industry for over 10 years. There are very few projects that have lasted as long or were as successful as ROS (1) Navigation. We would like to thank David Lu!! and Mike Ferguson for their tireless over the span of a decade to keep the Nav Stack alive and well. Without their hard work, this project would not have been able to happen. For a list of robots using Navigation2, see . Aslas, as time moves on, so must we. ROS (1) had a great run and those of us that build projects using it will remember it fondly(ish). With change comes possibilities. Navigation2 builds on the success but redesigns the framework to be more flexible and the feedback gathered over 10 years. We strive to create an open community and encourage new ROS users and experts alike to collaborate. However, that can't happen without your issues, pull requests, and support. Navigation, like all open-source projects, is kept going by a dedicated group of developers, maintainers, users, and collaborators. We would like to thank here our current and past contributors and maintainers.

This behavior tree will simply plan a new path to ``goal`` every 1 meter (set by ``DistanceController``) using ``ComputePathToPose``. If a new path is computed on the ``path`` blackboard variable, ``FollowPath`` will take this ``path`` and follow it using the server's default algorithm.

There are many example behavior trees provided in ``nav2_bt_navigator/behavior_trees``, but these sometimes have to be re-configured based on the application of the robot. The following document will walk through the current main default BT ``navigate_to_pose_w_replanning_and_recovery.xml`` in great detail. Prerequisites ============= Become familiar with the concept of a behavior tree before continuing with this walkthrough Read the short explanation in Read the general tutorial and guide (not Nav2 specific) on the website. Specifically, the \"Learn the Basics\" section on the BehaviorTree CPP V3 website explains the basic generic nodes that will be used that this guide will build upon. Become familiar with the custom Navigate To Pose With Replanning and Recovery ============================================= The following section will describe in detail the concept of the main and default BT currently used in Nav2, ``navigate_to_pose_w_replanning_and_recovery.xml``. This behavior tree replans the global path periodically at 1 Hz and it also has recovery actions. | ../images/walkthrough/overall_bt.png :align: center | BTs are primarily defined in XML. The tree shown above is represented in XML as follows. This is likely still a bit overwhelming, but this tree can be broken into two smaller subtrees that we can focus on one at a time. These smaller subtrees are the children of the top-most ``RecoveryNode``. From this point forward the ``NavigateWithReplanning`` subtree will be referred to as the ``Navigation`` subtree, and the ``RecoveryFallback`` subtree will be known as the ``Recovery`` subtree. This can be represented in the following way: | ../images/walkthrough/overall_bt_w_breakdown.png :align: center | The ``Navigation`` subtree mainly involves actual navigation behavior: calculating a path following a path contextual recovery behaviors for each of the above primary navigation behaviors The ``Recovery`` subtree includes behaviors for system level failures or items that were not easily dealt with internally. The overall BT will (hopefully) spend most of its time in the ``Navigation`` subtree. If either of the two main behaviors in the ``Navigation`` subtree fail (path calculation or path following), contextual recoveries will be attempted. If the contextual recoveries were still not enough, the ``Navigation`` subtree will return ``FAILURE``. The system will move on to the ``Recovery`` subtree to attempt to clear any system level navigation failures. This happens until the ``number_of_retries`` for the parent ``RecoveryNode`` is exceeded (which by default is 6). Navigation Subtree ====================== Now that we have gone over the control flow between the ``Navigation`` subtree and the ``Recovery`` subtree, let\\'s focus on the Navigation subtree. | ../images/walkthrough/navigation_subtree.png :align: center | The XML of this subtree is as follows: This subtree has two primary actions ``ComputePathToPose`` and ``FollowPath``. If either of these two actions fail, they will attempt to clear the failure contextually. The crux of the tree can be represented with only one parent and two children nodes like this: | ../images/walkthrough/navigation_subtree_bare.png :align: center | The parent ``PipelineSequence`` node allows the ``ComputePathToPose`` to be ticked, and once that succeeds, ``FollowPath`` to be ticked. While the ``FollowPath`` subtree is being ticked, the ``ComputePathToPose`` subtree will be ticked as well. This allows for the path to be recomputed as the robot moves around. Both the ``ComputePathToPose`` and the ``FollowPath`` follow the same general structure. Do the action If the action fails, try to see if we can contextually recover The below is the ``ComputePathToPose`` subtree: | ../images/walkthrough/contextual_recoveries.png :align: center | The parent ``RecoveryNode`` controls the flow between the action, and the contextual recovery subtree. The contextual recoveries for both ``ComputePathToPose`` and ``FollowPath`` involve checking if the goal has been updated, and involves clearing the relevant costmap. Consider changing the ``number_of_retries`` parameter in the parent ``RecoveryNode`` control node if your application can tolerate more attempts at contextual recoveries before moving on to system-level recoveries. The only differences in the BT subtree of ``ComputePathToPose`` and ``FollowPath`` are outlined below: The action node in the subtree: The ``ComputePathToPose`` subtree centers around the ``ComputePathToPose`` action. The ``FollowPath`` subtree centers around the ``FollowPath`` action. The ``RateController`` that decorates the ``ComputePathToPose`` subtree The ``RateController`` decorates the ``ComputePathToPose`` subtree to keep planning at the specified frequency. The default frequency for this BT is 1 hz. This is done to prevent the BT from flooding the planning server with too many useless requests at the tree update rate (100Hz). Consider changing this frequency to something higher or lower depending on the application and the computational cost of calculating the path. There are other decorators that can be used instead of the ``RateController``. Consider using the ``SpeedController`` or ``DistanceController`` decorators if appropriate. The costmap that is being cleared within the contextual recovery: The ``ComputePathToPose`` subtree clears the global costmap. The global costmap is the relevant costmap in the context of the planner The ``FollowPath`` subtree clears the local costmap. The local costmap is the relevant costmap in the context of the controller Recovery Subtree ================ The ``Recovery`` subtree is the second big \"half\" of the Nav2 default ``navigate_to_pose_w_replanning_and_recovery.xml`` tree. In short, this subtree is triggered when the ``Navigation`` subtree returns ``FAILURE`` and controls the recoveries at the system level (in the case the contextual recoveries in the ``Navigation`` subtree were not sufficient). | ../images/walkthrough/recovery_subtree.png :align: center | And the XML snippet: The top most parent, ``ReactiveFallback`` controls the flow between the rest of the system wide recoveries, and asynchronously checks if a new goal has been received. If at any point the goal gets updated, this subtree will halt all children and return ``SUCCESS``. This allows for quick reactions to new goals and preempt currently executing recoveries. This should look familiar to the contextual recovery portions of the ``Navigation`` subtree. This is a common BT pattern to handle the situation \"Unless \\'this condition\\' happens, Do action A\". These condition nodes can be extremely powerful and are typically paired with ``ReactiveFallback``. It can be easy to imagine wrapping this whole ``navigate_to_pose_w_replanning_and_recovery`` tree in a ``ReactiveFallback`` with a ``isBatteryLow`` condition -- meaning the ``navigate_to_pose_w_replanning_and_recovery`` tree will execute *unless* the battery becomes low (and then enter a different subtree for docking to recharge). If the goal is never updated, the behavior tree will go on to the ``RoundRobin`` node. These are the default four system-level recoveries in the BT are: A sequence that clears both costmaps (local, and global) ``Spin`` action ``Wait`` action ``BackUp`` action Upon ``SUCCESS`` of any of the four children of the parent ``RoundRobin``, the robot will attempt to renavigate in the ``Navigation`` subtree. If this renavigation was not successful, the next child of the ``RoundRobin`` will be ticked. For example, let\\'s say the robot is stuck and the ``Navigation`` subtree returns ``FAILURE``: (for the sake of this example, let\\'s assume that the goal is never updated). 1. The Costmap clearing sequence in the ``Recovery`` subtree is attempted, and returns ``SUCCESS``. The robot now moves to ``Navigation`` subtree again 2. Let\\'s assume that clearing both costmaps was not sufficient, and the ``Navigation`` subtree returns ``FAILURE`` once again. The robot now ticks the ``Recovery`` subtree 3. In the ``Recovery`` subtree, the ``Spin`` action will be ticked. If this returns ``SUCCESS``, then the robot will return to the main ``Navigation`` subtree *BUT* let\\'s assume that the ``Spin`` action returns ``FAILURE``. In this case, the tree will *remain* in the ``Recovery`` subtree 4. Let\\'s say the next action, ``Wait`` returns ``SUCCESS``. The robot will then move on to the ``Navigation`` subtree 5. Assume the ``Navigation`` subtree returns ``FAILURE`` (clearing the costmaps, attempting a spin, and waiting were *still* not sufficient to recover the system. The robot will move onto the ``Recovery`` subtree and attempt the ``BackUp`` action. Let\\'s say that the robot attempts the ``BackUp`` action and was able to successfully complete the action. The ``BackUp`` action node returns ``SUCCESS`` and so now we move on to the Navigation subtree again. 6. In this hypothetical scenario, let\\'s assume that the ``BackUp`` action allowed the robot to successfully navigate in the ``Navigation`` subtree, and the robot reaches the goal. In this case, the overall BT will still return ``SUCCESS``. If the ``BackUp`` action was not sufficient enough to allow the robot to become un-stuck, the above logic will go on indefinitely until the ``number_of_retries`` in the parent of the ``Navigate`` subtree and ``Recovery`` subtree is exceeded, or if all the system-wide recoveries in the ``Recovery`` subtree return ``FAILURE`` (this is unlikely, and likely points to some other system failure).'}\n",

A ``Node`` when discussing BTs is entirely different than a ``Node`` in the ROS 2 context An ``ActionNode`` in the context of BTs is not necessarily connected to an Action Server in the ROS 2 context (but often it is) There are quite a few custom Nav2 BT nodes that are provided to be used in the Nav2 specific fashion. Some commonly used Nav2 nodes will be described below. The full list of custom BT nodes can be found in the . The can also be quite useful. Action Nodes ------------ ComputePathToPose - ComputePathToPose Action Server Client (Planner Interface) FollowPath - FollowPath Action Server Client (Controller Interface) Spin, Wait, Backup - Behaviors Action Server Client ClearCostmapService - ClearCostmapService Server Clients Upon completion, these action nodes will return ``SUCCESS`` if the action server believes the action has been completed correctly, ``RUNNING`` when still running, and will return ``FAILURE`` otherwise. Note that in the above list, the `ClearCostmapService` action node is *not* an action server client, but a service client. Condition Nodes --------------- GoalUpdated - Checks if the goal on the goal topic has been updated GoalReached - Checks if the goal has been reached InitialPoseReceived - Checks to see if a pose on the ``intial_pose`` topic has been received isBatteryLow - Checks to see if the battery is low by listening on the battery topic The above list of condition nodes can be used to probe particular aspects of the system. Typically they will return ``SUCCESS`` if the condition is true and ``FAILURE`` otherwise. The key condition that is used in the default Nav2 BT is ``GoalUpdated`` which is checked asynchronously within particular subtrees. This condition node allows for the behavior described as \"If the goal has been updated, then we must replan\". Condition nodes are typically paired with ReactiveFallback nodes. Decorator Nodes --------------- Distance Controller - Will tick children nodes every time the robot has traveled a certain distance Rate Controller - Controls the ticking of its child node at a constant frequency. The tick rate is an exposed port Goal Updater - Will update the goal of children nodes via ports on the BT Single Trigger - Will only tick its child node once, and will return ``FAILURE`` for all subsequent ticks Speed Controller - Controls the ticking of its child node at a rate proportional to the robot\\'s speed Control: PipelineSequence ------------------------- The ``PipelineSequence`` control node re-ticks previous children when a child returns ``RUNNING``. This node is similar to the ``Sequence`` node, with the additional property that the children prior to the \"current\" are re-ticked, (resembling the flow of water in a pipe). If at any point a child returns ``FAILURE``, all children will be halted and the parent node will also return ``FAILURE``. Upon ``SUCCESS`` of the **last node** in the sequence, this node will halt and return ``SUCCESS``. To explain this further, here is an example BT that uses PipelineSequence. | ../images/control_pipelineSequence.png :align: center | 1. ``Action_A``, ``Action_B``, and ``Action_C`` are all ``IDLE``. 2. When the parent PipelineSequence is first ticked, let\\'s assume ``Action_A`` returns ``RUNNING``. The parent node will now return ``RUNNING`` and no other nodes are ticked. | ../images/control_pipelineSequence_RUNNING_IDLE_IDLE.png :align: center | 3. Now, let\\'s assume ``Action_A`` returns ``SUCCESS``, ``Action_B`` will now get ticked and will return ``RUNNING``. ``Action_C`` has not yet been ticked so will return ``IDLE``. | ../images/control_pipelineSequence_SUCCESS_RUNNING_IDLE.png :align: center | 4. ``Action_A`` gets ticked again and returns ``RUNNING``, and ``Action_B`` gets re-ticked and returns ``SUCCESS`` and therefore the BT goes on to tick ``Action_C`` for the first time. Let\\'s assume ``Action_C`` returns ``RUNNING``. The retick-ing of ``Action_A`` is what makes PipelineSequence useful. | ../images/control_pipelineSequence_RUNNING_SUCCESS_RUNNING.png :align: center | 5. All actions in the sequence will be re-ticked. Let\\'s assume ``Action_A`` still returns ``RUNNING``, where as ``Action_B`` returns ``SUCCESS`` again, and ``Action_C`` now returns ``SUCCESS`` on this tick. The sequence is now complete, and therefore ``Action_A`` is halted, even though it was still ``RUNNING``. | ../images/control_pipelineSequence_RUNNING_SUCCESS_SUCCESS.png :align: center | Recall that if ``Action_A``, ``Action_B``, or ``Action_C`` returned ``FAILURE`` at any point of time, the parent would have returned ``FAILURE`` and halted any children as well. For additional details regarding the ``PipelineSequence`` please see the . Control: Recovery --------------------- The Recovery control node has only two children and returns ``SUCCESS`` if and only if the first child returns ``SUCCESS``. If the first child returns ``FAILURE``, the second child will be ticked. This loop will continue until either: The first child returns ``SUCCESS`` (which results in ``SUCCESS`` of the parent node) The second child returns ``FAILURE`` (which results in ``FAILURE`` of the parent node) The ``number_of_retries`` input parameter is violated This node is usually used to link together an action, and a recovery action as the name suggests. The first action will typically be the \"main\" behavior, and the second action will be something to be done in case of ``FAILURE`` of the main behavior. Often, the ticking of the second child action will promote the chance the first action will succeed. | ../images/control_recovery_node.png :align: center | In the above example, let\\'s assume ``ComputePathToPose`` fails. ``ClearLocalCostmap`` will be ticked in response, and return ``SUCCESS``. Now that we have cleared the costmap, let\\'s say the robot is correctly able to compute the path and ``ComputePathToPose`` now returns ``SUCCESS``. Then, the parent RecoveryNode will also return ``SUCCESS`` and the BT will be complete. For additional details regarding the ``RecoveryNode`` please see the . Control: RoundRobin ----------------------- The RoundRobin control node ticks its children in a round robin fashion until a child returns ``SUCCESS``, in which the parent node will also return ``SUCCESS``. If all children return ``FAILURE`` so will the parent RoundRobin. Here is an example BT we will use to walk through the concept. | ../images/control_round_robin.png :align: center | 1. All the nodes start at ``IDLE`` | ../images/control_round_robin_IDLE_IDLE_IDLE.png :align: center | 2. Upon tick of the parent node, the first child (``Action_A``) is ticked. Let\\'s assume on tick the child returns ``RUNNING``. In this case, no other children are ticked and the parent node returns ``RUNNING`` as well. | ../images/control_round_robin_RUNNING_IDLE_IDLE.png :align: center | 3. Upon the next tick, let\\'s assume that ``Action_A`` returns ``FAILURE``. This means that ``Action_B`` will get ticked next, and ``Action_C`` remains unticked. Let\\'s assume ``Action_B`` returns ``RUNNING`` this time. That means the parent RoundRobin node will also return ``RUNNING``. | ../images/control_round_robin_FAILURE_RUNNING_IDLE.png :align: center | 4. Upon this next tick, let\\'s assume that ``Action_B`` returns ``SUCCESS``. The parent RoundRobin will now halt all children and return ``SUCCESS``. The parent node retains this state information, and will tick ``Action_C`` upon the next tick rather than start from ``Action_A`` like Step 2 did. | ../images/control_round_robin_FAILURE_SUCCESS_IDLE.png :align: center | 5. On this tick, let\\'s assume ``Action_C`` returns ``RUNNING``, and so does the parent RoundRobin. No other nodes are ticked. | ../images/control_round_robin_FAILURE_SUCCESS_RUNNING.png :align: center | 6. On this last tick, let\\'s assume ``Action_C`` returns ``FAILURE``. The parent will circle and tick ``Action_A`` again. ``Action_A`` returns ``RUNNING`` and so will the parent RoundRobin node. This pattern will continue indefinitely unless all children return ``FAILURE``. | ../images/control_round_robin_RUNNING_IDLE_FAILURE.png :align: center | For additional details regarding the ``RecoveryNode`` please see the .'}\n",

In this tree, we replan at 1 hz just as we did in using the ``ComputePathToPose`` node. However, this time when we replan, we update the ``goal`` based on the newest information in on the updated goal topic. After we plan a path to this dynamic point, we use the ``TruncatePath`` node to remove path points from the end of the path near the dynamic point. This behavior tree node is useful so that the robot always remains at least ``distance`` away from the obstacle, even if it stops. It also smooths out any off path behavior involved with trying to path plan towards a probably occupied space in the costmap. After the new path to the dynamic point is computed and truncated, it is again passed to the controller via the ``FollowPath`` node.

It contains both use of custom behaviors for recovery in specific sub-contexts as well as a global recovery subtree for system-level failures. It also provides the opportunity for users to retry tasks multiple times before returning a failed state. The ``ComputePathThroughPoses`` and ``FollowPath`` BT nodes both also specify their algorithms to utilize. By convention we name these by the style of algorithms that they are (e.g. not ``DWB`` but rather ``FollowPath``) such that a behavior tree or application developer need not worry about the technical specifics. They just want to use a path following controller. In this behavior tree, we attempt to retry the entire navigation task 6 times before returning to the caller that the task has failed. This allows the navigation system ample opportunity to try to recovery from failure conditions or wait for transient issues to pass, such as crowding from people or a temporary sensor failure. In nominal execution, this will replan the path at every 3 seconds and pass that path onto the controller, similar to the behavior tree in . The planner though is now ``ComputePathThroughPoses`` taking a vector, ``goals``, rather than a single pose ``goal`` to plan to. The ``RemovePassedGoals`` node is used to cull out ``goals`` that the robot has passed on its path. In this case, it is set to remove a pose from the poses when the robot is within ``0.5`` of the goal and it is the next goal in the list. This is implemented such that replanning can be computed after the robot has passed by some of the intermediary poses and not continue to try to replan through them in the future. This time, if the planner fails, it will trigger contextually aware recoveries in its subtree, clearing the global costmap. Additional recoveries can be added here for additional context-specific recoveries, such as trying another algorithm. Similarly, the controller has similar logic. If it fails, it also attempts a costmap clearing of the local costmap impacting the controller. It is worth noting the ``GoalUpdated`` node in the reactive fallback. This allows us to exit recovery conditions when a new goal has been passed to the navigation system through a preemption. This ensures that the navigation system will be very responsive immediately when a new goal is issued, even when the last goal was in an attempted recovery. If these contextual recoveries fail, this behavior tree enters the recovery subtree. This subtree is reserved for system-level failures to help resolve issues like the robot being stuck or in a bad spot. This subtree also has the ``GoalUpdated`` BT node it ticks every iteration to ensure responsiveness of new goals. Next, the recovery subtree will tick the costmap clearing operations, spinning, waiting, and backing up. After each of the recoveries in the subtree, the main navigation subtree will be reattempted. If it continues to fail, the next recovery in the recovery subtree is ticked. While this behavior tree does not make use of it, the ``PlannerSelector``, ``ControllerSelector``, and ``GoalCheckerSelector`` behavior tree nodes can also be helpful. Rather than hardcoding the algorithm to use (``GridBased`` and ``FollowPath``), these behavior tree nodes will allow a user to dynamically change the algorithm used in the navigation system via a ROS topic. It may be instead advisable to create different subtree contexts using condition nodes with specified algorithms in their most useful and unique situations. However, the selector nodes can be a useful way to change algorithms from an external application rather than via internal behavior tree control flow logic. It is better to implement changes through behavior tree methods, but we understand that many professional users have external applications to dynamically change settings of their navigators.'}\n",

This behavior tree is a soft extension to the . Apart from the functionalities of , this behavior tree allows the robot to efficiently handle an obstacle (e.g. forklift, person, or other temporary obstacles) close to the goal by pausing the robot's navigation and wait for a user-specified time to check if the obstacle has cleared. If the obstacle has moved during the waiting time, the robot will continue to the goal taking the shorter path. If the obstacle has not moved during the waiting time or the waiting time expires, then the robot will use the longer path around to reach the final goal location. Ultimately, for a given task, this behavior tree aids in solving the problem of long cycle time, which is caused because of the long path generated due to the temporary obstacles present close to the goal location. The behavior tree is depicted in the image below. From the image, it can be noted that there is an additional branch in the Navigation Subtree known as ``MonitorAndFollowPath``. This branch is created with the intention for the users to perform any kind of monitoring behavior that their robot should exhibit. In this particular BT, the monitoring branch is exclusively utilized by ``PathLongerOnApproach`` BT node for checking if the global planner has decided to plan a significantly longer path for the robot on approaching the user-specified goal proximity. If there is no significantly longer path, the monitor node goes into the ``FollowPath`` recovery node, which then generates the necessary control commands. ../images/walkthrough/patience_and_recovery.png Once there is a significantly longer path, the child node for the ``PathLongerOnApproach`` node ticks. The child node is a ``RetryUntilSuccesfull`` decorator node, which inturns have a ``SequenceStar`` node as its child. Firstly, the ``SequenceStar`` node cancels the controller server by ticking the ``CancelControl`` node. The cancellation of the controller server halts the further navigation of the robot. Next, the ``SequenceStar`` node ticks the ``Wait`` node, which enables the robot to wait for the given user-specified time. Here we need to note that, the ``MonitorAndFollowPath`` is a ``ReactiveSequence`` node, therefore the ``PathLongerOnApproach`` node needs to return SUCCESS, before the ``FollowPath`` node can be ticked once again. In the below GIF, it can be seen that the robot is approaching the goal location, but it found an obstacle in the goal proximity, because of which the global planner, plans a longer path around. This is the point where the ``PathLongerOnApproach`` ticks and ticks its children, consequently cancelling the ``controller_server`` and waiting to see if the obstacle clears up. In the below scenario, the obstacles do not clear, causing the robot to take the longer path. ../../migration/images/nav2_patience_near_goal_and_go_around.gif Alternatively, if the obstacles are cleared, then there is a shorter path generated by the global planner. Now, the ``PathLongerOnApproach`` returns SUCCESS, that cause the ``FollowPath`` to continue with the robot navigation. ../../migration/images/nav2_patience_near_goal_and_clear_obstacle.gif Apart from the above scenarios, we also need to note that, the robot will take the longer path to the goal location if the obstacle does not clear up in the given user-specific wait time. In conclusion, this particular BT would serve, both as an example and ready-to-use BT for an organizational specific application, that wishes to optimize its process cycle time.

Please use PlanningScene::checkCollision(..) with a req.padenvironmentcollisions = false; [12/2023] trajectoryprocessing::Path and trajectoryprocessing::Trajectory APIs have been updated to prevent misuse. The constructors have been replaced by builder methods so that errors can be communicated. Paths and trajectories now need to be created with Path::Create() and Trajectory::Create(). These methods now return an std::optional that needs to be checked for a valid value. Trajectory no longer has the isValid() method. If it\\'s invalid, Trajectory::Create() will return std::nullopt. Finally, Path now takes the list of input waypoints as std::vector, instead of std::list. [12/2023] LMA kinematics plugin is removed to remove the maintenance work because better alternatives exist like KDL or TracIK [10/2023] The planning pipeline now has a vector of planner plugins rather than a single one. Please update the planner plugin parameter e.g. like this: ``diff planningplugin: omplinterface/OMPLPlanner + planningplugins: + - omplinterface/OMPLPlanner ` [10/2023] Planning request adapters are now separated into PlanRequest (preprocessing) and PlanResponse (postprocessing) adapters. The adapters are configured with ROS parameter vectors (vector order corresponds to execution order). Please update your pipeline configurations for example like this: `diff requestadapters: >- defaultplannerrequestadapters/AddTimeOptimalParameterization defaultplannerrequestadapters/ResolveConstraintFrames defaultplannerrequestadapters/FixWorkspaceBounds defaultplannerrequestadapters/FixStartStateBounds defaultplannerrequestadapters/FixStartStateCollision defaultplannerrequestadapters/FixStartStatePathConstraints + The order of the elements in the adapter corresponds to the order they are processed by the motion planning pipeline. + requestadapters: + - defaultplanningrequestadapters/ResolveConstraintFrames + - defaultplanningrequestadapters/ValidateWorkspaceBounds + - defaultplanningrequestadapters/CheckStartStateBounds + - defaultplanningrequestadapters/CheckStartStateCollision + responseadapters: + - defaultplanningresponseadapters/AddTimeOptimalParameterization + - defaultplanningresponseadapters/ValidateSolution + - defaultplanningresponseadapters/DisplayMotionPath ` [2021] lockSceneRead() and lockSceneWrite() are now protected member functions, for internal use only. To lock the planning scene, use LockedPlanningSceneRO or LockedPlanningSceneRW: ` planningscenemonitor::LockedPlanningSceneRO ls(planningscenemonitor); moveit::core::RobotModelConstPtr model = ls->getRobotModel(); ` [2021] ServoServer was renamed to ServoNode [2021] CollisionObject messages are now defined with a Pose, and shapes and subframes are defined relative to the object\\'s pose. This makes it easier to place objects with subframes and multiple shapes in the scene. This causes several changes: getFrameTransform() now returns this pose instead of the first shape\\'s pose. The Rviz plugin\\'s manipulation tab now uses the object\\'s pose instead of the shape pose to evaluate if object\\'s are in the region of interest. Planning scene geometry text files (.scene) have changed format. Loading old files is still supported. You can add a line 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 under each line with an asterisk to upgrade old files. [2021] Add API for passing RNG to setToRandomPositionsNearBy [2021] Static member variable interface of the CollisionDetectorAllocatorTemplate for the string NAME was replaced with a virtual method getName. [2021] Enhance RDFLoader to load from string parameter OR string topic (and add the ability to publish a string topic). ROS Noetic RobotModel no longer overrides empty URDF collision geometry by matching the visual geometry of the link. Planned trajectories are slow by default. The default values of the velocityscalingfactor and accelerationscalingfactor can now be customized and default to 0.1 instead of 1.0. The values can be changed by setting the parameters defaultaccelerationscalingfactor and defaultvelocityscalingfactor in the jointlimits.yaml of your robot\\'s moveitconfig package. Consider setting them to values between 0.2 and 0.6, to allow for significant speedup/slowdown of your application. Additionally, you can always change the factors per request with the corresponding methods in the movegroupinterface, the MoveGroupCommander or in the Rviz interface. (1890) Extended the return value of MoveitCommander.MoveGroup.plan() from trajectory to a tuple of (success, trajectory, planningtime, errorcode) to better match the C++ MoveGroupInterface (790) moveitrviz.launch, generated by MSA, provides an argument rvizconfig to configure the rviz config to be used. The old boolean config argument was dropped. (1397) Moved the example package moveitcontrollermanagerexample into moveittutorials Requests to getplanningscene service without explicitly setting \"components\" now return full scene moveitrosplanning no longer depends on moveitrosperception CollisionRobot and CollisionWorld are combined into a single CollisionEnv class. This applies for all derived collision checkers as FCL, ALLVALID, HYBRID and DISTANCEFIELD. Consequently, getCollisionRobot[Unpadded] / getCollisionWorld functions are replaced through a getCollisionEnv in the planning scene and return the new combined environment. This unified collision environment provides the union of all member functions of CollisionRobot and CollisionWorld. Note that calling checkRobotCollision of the CollisionEnv does not take a CollisionRobot as an argument anymore as it is implicitly contained in the CollisionEnv. RobotTrajectory provides a copy constructor that allows a shallow (default) and deep copy of waypoints Replace the redundant namespaces robotstate:: and robotmodel:: with the actual namespace moveit::core::. The additional namespaces will disappear in the future (ROS2). Moved the library moveitcpp to moveitrosplanning. The classes are now in namespace moveitcpp, access via moveit::planninginterface is deprecated. The joint states of passive joints must be published in ROS and the CurrentStateMonitor will now wait for them as well. Their semantics dictate that they cannot be actively controlled, but they must be known to use the full robot state in collision checks. (https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/2663) Removed deprecated header moveit/macros/deprecation.h. Use [[deprecated]] instead. All uses of MOVEITCLASSFORWARD et. al. must now be followed by a semicolon for consistency (and to get -pedantic builds to pass for the codebase). In case you start RViz in a namespace, the default topic for the trajectory visualization display now uses the relative instead of the absolute namespace (i.e. /movegroup/displayplannedpath instead of /movegroup/displayplannedpath). RobotState::attachBody() now takes a uniqueptr instead of an owning raw pointer. Moved the class MoveItErrorCode from both moveitrosplanning and moveitrosplanninginterface to moveitcore. The class now is in namespace moveit::core, access via moveit::planninginterface or moveitcpp::PlanningComponent is deprecated. End-effector markers in rviz are shown only if the eef\\'s parent group is active and the parent link is part of that group. Before, these conditions were OR-connected. You might need to define additional end-effectors. Removed ConstraintSampler::project() as there was no real difference to sample(). Removed TrajectoryExecutionManager::pushAndExecute() and the code associated to it. The code was unused and broken. ROS Melodic Migration to tf2 API. Replaced Eigen::Affine3d with Eigen::Isometry3d, which is computationally more efficient. Simply find-replace occurrences of Affine3d: find . -iname \".[hc]\" -print0 | xargs -0 sed -i \\'s#Affine3#Isometry3#g\\' The movegroup capability ExecuteTrajectoryServiceCapability has been removed in favor of the improved ExecuteTrajectoryActionCapability capability. Since Indigo, both capabilities were supported. If you still load default capabilities in your config/launch/movegroup.launch, you can just remove them from the capabilities parameter. The correct default capabilities will be loaded automatically. Deprecated method CurrentStateMonitor::waitForCurrentState(double waittime) was finally removed. Renamed RobotState::getCollisionBodyTransforms to getCollisionBodyTransform as it returns a single transform only. Removed deprecated class MoveGroup (was renamed to MoveGroupInterface). KinematicsBase: Deprecated members tipframe, searchdiscretization. Use tipframes and redundantjointdiscretization instead. KinematicsBase: Deprecated initialize(robotdescription, ...) in favour of initialize(robotmodel, ...). Adapt your kinematics plugin to directly receive a RobotModel. See the KDL plugin for an example. IK: Removed notion of IK attempts and redundant random seeding in RobotState::setFromIK(). Number of attempts is limited by timeout only. (#1288) Remove parameters kinematicssolverattempts from your kinematics.yaml config files. RDFLoader / RobotModelLoader: removed TinyXML-based API (https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/1254) Deprecated EndEffectorInteractionStyle got removed from RobotInteraction (https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/pull/1287) Use the corresponding InteractionStyle definitions instead ROS Kinetic In the C++ MoveGroupInterface class the plan() method returns a MoveItErrorCode object and not a boolean. staticcast(mgi.plan()) can be used to achieve the old behavior. CurrentStateMonitor::waitForCurrentState(double waittime) has been renamed to waitForCompleteState to better reflect the actual semantics. Additionally a new method waitForCurrentState(const ros::Time t = ros::Time::now()) was added that actually waits until all joint updates are newer than t`. To avoid deadlocks, the PlanningSceneMonitor listens to its own EventQueue, monitored by an additional spinner thread. Providing a custom NodeHandle, a user can control which EventQueue and processing thread is used instead. Providing a default NodeHandle, the old behavior (using the global EventQueue) can be restored, which is however not recommended.'}\n",

ROS 2 provides similar macros (i.e. RCLCPPINFO) that instead of an optional name always require a rclcpp::Logger instance for scoping the namespace. In ROS 2 logging is tied to the Node object for publishing to /rosout. For namespaces there is the option of creating a child logger. However because of initaliziation order (child logger has to be created after rclcpp::init is called and from a method on the logger from the node) you can no longer define the logger object as a file level static. moveitcore provides a util library which contains some functions to make this situation more ergonomic. ``C++ #include ` Wherever the node is created there is the option to set the root logging namespace to be from the node for moveit using this syntax: `C++ moveit::setNodeLoggerName(node->getname()); ` Then wherever you call a logging macro you can use the moveit::getLogger() function: `C++ RCLCPPINFO(moveit::getLogger(\"mynamespace\"), \"Very important info message\"); ` Logger naming convention Migrating the loggers is a good opportunity to make logger names more consistent. In order to create unique and descriptive logger names we encourage the following naming pattern: general LIBRARYNAME.SOURCEFILENAME. For finding the LIBRARYNAME refer to the line addlibrary(LIBRARYNAME ...) in the library\\'s CMakeLists.txt. If the source file name is the same or very similar to the library name it is sufficient to only use the source file name. Logging in header files Some classes declared in header files may contain log messages, for instance to warn about not-implemented virtual functions in abstract classes.

Then, in the main MoveIt README.md file, remove the \"ROS Buildfarm\" header and the following table. Finally, from your catkin workspace with every MoveIt package, run the createreadmetable.py script. For example: cd ~/wsmoveit/src python moveit/moveit/scripts/createreadmetable.py >> moveit/README.md HTML Table Generator This python script will generate an html page with useful data about every package in the current folder the script is run in.

As pointed out in , only OMPL actually explicitly declares planner_configs on the parameter server. To enable all other pipelines as well (and thus circumventing the original filter mechanism), introduced empty dummy planner_configs for all other planners as well (CHOMP + Pilz). This, obviously, renders the whole filter mechanism useless. Thus, here we just remove the function getPlanningPipelineNames() and the corresponding member groups_pipelines_map_.

This commits a testcase using the old scene format. It will fail and a subsequent commit to introduce backwards compatibility to the scene-file parsing will make it pass. [moveit_core] PlanningScene: Add backwards compatibility for old scene version format This commit adds a mechanism for detecting the version of the scene file format to enable the loadGeometryFromStream method to read old version scene files without having to migrate them. To detect the version of the scene format, we use the content of the line following the start of an object: In the old version of the format, this specified the number of shapes in the object (a single int). In the new version of the format, it is the translational part of the pose of the object (i.e. three double values separated by spaces).

This resembles the virtual_joint of SRDF. However, the RobotModel parser issues the following warning: Skipping virtual joint \\'xxx\\' because its child frame \\'xxx\\' does not match the URDF frame \\'world\\' Drop the minimum velocity/acceleration limits for TOTG () Just complain about negative / zero values. Fix Debug build: re-add seemingly unused arguments Merge (add RobotState::getRigidlyAttachedParentLink) Merge branch \\'pr-master-state-rigidly-attached-parent\\' add RS::getRigidlyConnectedParentLinkModel to resolve links for attached objects as well consistent parameter names for AttachedBody constructor \"attach_posture\" is plain wrong.

Needs more analysis! Fix unused-variable warning Silent unused-function warnings Remove unused arguments from global_adjustment_factor() Looks like, dt and x were passed originally to call fit_cubic_spline() inside that function. However, later it was assumed that fit_cubic_spline() was already called, rendering these parameters superfluous. Simplify API: Remove obviously unused arguments clang-tidy: fix unused parameter (critical cases) This warnings should be considered in more detail (TODO). Not using these arguments might be an actual bug. clang-tidy: fix unused parameter (uncritical cases) These parameters aren\\'t used for an obvious reason. moveit_build_options() Declare common build options like CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD, CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE, and compiler options (namely warning flags) once. Each package depending on moveit_core can use these via moveit_build_options(). RobotState: write to correct array () Not an actual bug because both arrays share the same memory.

Since calculating the SVD of a Jacobian is a costly operation, I propose to retain the calculation of the Manipulability Index through the determinant for 6 or more DOF (where it produces the correct result), but use the product of the singular values of the Jacobian for fewer DOF. Fixed missing test depends for tf_conversions Allow setFromIK() with multiple poses to single IK solver Improved debug output Removed duplicate functionality poseToMsg function New setToRandomPositions function with custom rand num generator Moved find_package angles to within CATKIN_ENABLE_TESTING Getter for all tips (links) of every end effector in a joint model group New robot state to (file) stream conversion functions Added default values for iostream in print statements Change PlanningScene constructor to RobotModelConstPtr Documentation and made printTransform() public Reduced unnecessary joint position copying Added getSubgroups() helper function to joint model groups Maintain ordering of poses in order that IK solver expects Added new setToRandomPositions function that allows custom random number generator to be specified Split setToIKSolverFrame() into two functions Add check for correct solver type Allowed setFromIK to do whole body IK solving with multiple tips Contributors: Acorn, Dave Coleman, Ioan A Sucan, Jonathan Weisz, Konstantinos Chatzilygeroudis, Sachin Chitta, hersh 0.5.10 (2014-06-30) ------------------- making Saucy and Trusty version of includes to be compatible with upstream packaging. re: https://github.com/ros/rosdistro/issues/4633 Contributors: Tully Foote 0.5.9 (2014-06-23) ------------------ Fixed bug in RevoluteJointModel::distance() giving large negative numbers. kinematics_base: added an optional RobotState for context. fix pick/place approach/retreat on indigo/14.04 Fixed bug in RevoluteJointModel::distance() giving large negative numbers. IterativeParabolicTimeParameterization now ignores virtual joints. kinematics_base: added an optional RobotState for context. Removed check for multi-dof joints in iterative_time_parameterization.cpp. fix pick/place approach/retreat on indigo/14.04 IterativeParabolicTimeParameterization now ignores virtual joints. When checking if all joints are single-DOF, it accepts multi-DOF joints only if they are also virtual. Fix compiler warnings Address [cppcheck: unreadVariable] warning. Address [cppcheck: postfixOperator] warning. Address [cppcheck: stlSize] warning. Address [-Wunused-value] warning. Address [-Wunused-variable] warning. Address [-Wreturn-type] warning. Address [-Wsign-compare] warning. Address [-Wreorder] warning. Allow joint model group to have use IK solvers with multiple tip frames KinematicsBase support for multiple tip frames and IK requests with multiple poses dynamics_solver: fix crashbug Ignore joint that does not exist (including the virtual joint if it is part of the group). Changed KinematicsBase::supportsGroup() to use a more standard call signature. Merged with hydro-devel Removed unnecessary error output Removed todo Added support for legacy IK calls without solution_callback Merge branch \\'hydro-devel\\' into kinematic_base Changed KinematicsBase::supportsGroup() to use a more standard call signature. Added empty check. computeCartesianPath waypoints double-up fix computeCartesianPath appends full trajectories between waypoints when given a vector of waypoints. As trajectories include their endpoints, this leads to the combined trajectory being generated with duplicate points at waypoints, which can lead to pauses or stuttering. This change skips the first point in trajectories generated between waypoints. avoid unnecessary calculations Created supportsGroup() test for IK solvers from ros-planning/more-travis-tests More Travis test fixes. Commented out failing test. run_tests_moveit_ros_perception requires glut library, and thus a video card or X server, but I haven\\'t had any luck making such things work on Travis. avoid unnecessary calculations If we are not going to use the missing vector then we should not create it (avoid an expensive operation). Code cleanup Allow joint model group to have use IK solvers with multiple tip frames Authorship Fixed missing removeSlash to setValues() Feedback and cleaned up comment lengths Cleaned up commit KinematicsBase support for multiple tip frames and IK requests with multiple poses More Travis test fixes. Switched test_constraint_samplers.cpp from build-time to run-time reference to moveit_resources. Added passing run_tests_moveit_core_gtest_test_robot_state_complex test to .travis.yml. Added \\'make tests\\' to .travis.yml to make all tests, even failing ones.

      "{'_id': ObjectId('674fc48a420c5b5d2de0e521'), 'file_name': 'install.md', 'source': 'GitHub', 'repo': 'gazebo_simulation', 'file_url': 'https://github.com/gazebosim/docs/blob/master/acropolis/install.md', 'content': 'Acropolis has reached end-of-life on September 2019. This page exists for archival purposes. Please refer to the latest supported version. Acropolis Installation Acropolis supports the following platforms: Ubuntu Bionic on amd64/i386 MacOS Mojave Windows support is still experimental although most of the packages should work as expected. There are no binaries for Windows at this moment. The gz-sim package is still not available for Windows, the installation should be done from source code. Acropolis Libraries The Acropolis collection is composed by many different Gazebo libraries. The collection assures that all libraries all compatible and can be used together. | Library name | Version | | ------------------ |:-------------:| | gz-cmake | 2.x | | gz-common | 3.x | | gz-fuel-tools | 3.x | | gz-sim | 1.x | | gz-gui | 1.x | | gz-launch | 0.x | | gz-math | 6.x | | gz-msgs | 3.x | | gz-physics | 1.x | | gz-plugin | 1.x | | gz-rendering | 1.x | | gz-sensors | 1.x | | gz-tools | 0.x | | gz-transport | 6.x | | sdformat | 8.x | Option 1: Installation on Ubuntu Bionic All of the Acropolis binaries are hosted in the osrfoundation repository. To install all of them, the metapackage gazebo-acropolis can be installed: ``bash sudo sh -c \\'echo \"deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable lsbrelease -cs main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list\\' wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add - sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install gazebo-acropolis ` All libraries should be ready to use and the gz-sim app ready to be executed. Option 2: Install on MacOS Mojave (10.14) All the Acropolis binaries are available in Mojave using the homebrew package manager. The homebrew tool can easily be installed using: `bash /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\" ` After installing the homebrew package manager, Gazebo Acropolis can be installed running: `bash brew tap osrf/simulation brew install gazebo-acropolis ` All libraries should be ready to use and the gz-sim app ready to be executed. Option 3: Source Installation (any platform) The use of some additional tools is recommended to help with the source compilation, although other ways of correctly getting and building the sources are also possible. Colcon supports python 3.5 (or higher) which is not the default option in some platforms (like Ubuntu Bionic). The python virtualenv could be a useful solution in cases where the default option can not be easily changed. Installing vcstool and colcon For getting the sources of all libraries the easiest way is to use vcstool. The tool is available from pip in all platforms: `bash pip install vcstool ` To compile all the different libraries and gz-sim in the right order it is recommended to use colcon. The colcon tool is available in all platforms using pip: `bash pip install -U colcon-common-extensions ` Use .deb packages in Ubuntu to install vcstool and colcon An alternative method is to use the .deb packages available on Debian or Ubuntu: `bash sudo sh -c \\'echo \"deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsbrelease -sc) main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list\\' sudo apt-get install curl if curl isn\\'t already installed curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add - sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install python3-vcstool python3-colcon-common-extensions ` Getting the sources The instructions below use some UNIX commands to manage directories but the obvious alternatives on Windows should provide the same result. The first step would be to create a developer workspace in which vcstool and colcon can work. `bash mkdir -p ~/workspace/src cd ~/workspace/src ` All the sources of gazebo-acropolis are declared in a yaml file. Download it to the workspace. `bash wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gazebo-tooling/gazebodistro/master/collection-acropolis.yaml ` Use vcstool to automatically retrieve all the Gazebo libraries sources from their repositories: `bash vcs import /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list\\' wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add - sudo apt-get update ` As reference the command below will install all dependencies in Ubuntu Bionic: `bash sudo apt-get install cmake freeglut3-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libdart6-collision-ode-dev libdart6-dev libdart6-utils-urdf-dev libfreeimage-dev libgflags-dev libglew-dev libgts-dev libogre-1.9-dev libogre-2.1-dev libprotobuf-dev libprotobuf-dev libprotoc-dev libqt5core5a libswscale-dev libtinyxml2-dev libtinyxml-dev pkg-config protobuf-compiler qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel qml-module-qt-labs-settings qml-module-qtquick2 qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-dialogs qml-module-qtquick-layouts qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev ruby ruby-ronn uuid-dev libgtest-dev curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsqlite3-dev ` Building the Gazebo Libraries The Gazebo Libraries require the following compilers on each platform: Ubuntu Bionic: gcc 8 MacOS Mojave: Xcode 10 Windows: Visual Studio 2017 Installing gcc version 8 on Ubuntu Bionic To install gcc version 8 on Ubuntu Bionic: `bash sudo apt-get install g++-8 ` Set gcc-8 and g++-8 to be the default compilers. `bash sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 800 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 --slave /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-8 ` At this point gcc and g++ should both report version 8. Test this with the following commands. `bash gcc -v g++ -v ` Building the colcon workspace Once the compiler and all the sources are in place it is time to compile them. Start the procedure by changing into the workspace and listing the packages recognized by colcon: `bash cd ~/workspace/ colcon list -g ` colcon should list the Gazebo libraries with their interdependencies. If that is the case, then you are ready to build the whole set of libraries: `bash colcon build ` If there are no errors, all the binaries should be ready to use. Using the workspace The workspace binaries are ready but every time that gz-sim needs to be executed or third party code is going to be developed using the Gazebo libraries, one command is needed: `bash . ~/workspace/install/localsetup.bash (or call ~/workspace/install/localsetup.bat on Windows) `` After running the command all paths for running apps or developing code will be set in the current shell.'}\n",

As an executable, it runs a simulation by launching two processes: the backend server process and frontend client process. The core functionality of Gazebo Sim is the client-server communication and the various plugins it loads to facilitate the simulation. Plugins are libraries that are loaded at runtime. They allow Gazebo Sim to utilize other Gazebo libraries. There are many plugin types in the Gazebo framework. For example, there are plugins that introduce new physics engines or rendering engines. However, for the purpose of this document, any mention of plugins is referring only to Gazebo Sim server and GUI plugins. Because they’re loaded at runtime, Gazebo does not need to be recompiled to add or remove plugins. Gazebo Sim ships with many plugins by default (Server plugins, Gazebo GUI plugins, Gazebo Sim GUI plugins, and more), all of which are optional and can be removed by the user. Users can also add more plugins and even write their own plugins that will be compiled into library files. Gazebo libraries are modular. Plugins let Gazebo Sim utilize other libraries. For example, Gazebo Physics and Gazebo Sim are independent of one another, so Gazebo Sim has a physics plugin that uses Gazebo Physics as a library and incorporates Gazebo specifics, allowing Physics to be a system running in the simulation loop. The Gazebo Physics library is only used in the physics plugin, not in other plugins nor in the core of Gazebo Sim. Some libraries are only used by one plugin, or one in each process (frontend and backend). However, some foundational libraries are used by all plugins, like Gazebo Common which provides common functionality like logging, manipulating strings, file system interaction, etc., to all plugins. Other such libraries include Gazebo Plugin, Gazebo Math, SDFormat, and more. There are certain plugins in both the frontend and backend processes that are loaded by default in every version of Gazebo. Many other plugins are optional. One common optional plugin is the sensors plugin. Both optional and default plugins can be removed or added at any time; Gazebo Sim will continue to run with limited functionality. These demos on Server Configuration and GUI Configuration showcase that functionality. The simulation process is depicted in the diagram below, and further explained in the Backend and Frontend process sections that follow. !Gazebo Sim architecture diagram Backend server process Gazebo Sim is responsible for loading plugins in the backend, referred to as systems. The server runs an entity-component system architecture (see Gazebo Sim terminology). The backend will usually have multiple systems responsible for everything in the simulation – computing physics, recording logs, receiving user commands, etc. Systems act on entities and components of those entities. An entity is anything in the simulation scene (a model, link, light, actor, etc.), and components are their characteristics (pose, name, geometry, etc.). Server plugins have access to all entities and what components they have, and make modifications to those components. For example, a user could write a system that applies force to an entity by setting a component on that entity, and the physics system would pick that up and react by applying the force to make the entity actually move. The modification of entities and components is how server plugins communicate with each other. The entity component system is self-contained in Gazebo Sim, and systems act on entities and their components. Since other Gazebo Libraries don't have direct knowledge/access to entities and components, other Gazebo Libraries should be used in systems so that the server plugin can share entities (and their components) with these other Libraries. For example, the physics system shares entities and components with the Gazebo Physics library in order to achieve physics effects on entities and components. There is a loop running in the backend that runs the systems, where some systems are proposing changes to entities and their components, and other systems are handling and applying those changes. This is called the “simulation loop”. The Entity Component Manager (ECM) in the backend provides the functionality for the actual querying and updating of the entities and components. Physics, User Commands, and Scene Broadcaster are all systems launched by default in the backend. As mentioned earlier, however, even default systems can be added to or removed from the simulation loop (the Server Configuration tutorial describes how to customize default systems). For any other functionality, like sensor data processing for example, an additional system would have to be loaded. For example, if you need to generate sensor data that utilizes rendering sensors, you would need to load the sensors system. The visualization of that data, however, is left up to the client side plugins. Communication process Any information that crosses the process boundary (whether back-to-front with scene broadcaster or front-to-back with user commands) has to go through Gazebo Transport, the communication library. Synchronization between processes is performed by scene broadcaster, a server-side Gazebo Sim plugin that uses the Gazebo Transport and Gazebo Messages libraries to send messages from the server to the client. The messages themselves are provided by Gazebo Messages, while the framework for creating the publishers and subscribers that exchange messages is from Gazebo Transport. The scene broadcaster system is responsible for getting the state of the world (all of the entities and their component values) from the ever-changing simulation loop running in the back end, packaging that information into a very compact message, and periodically sending it to the frontend process. Omitting the scene broadcaster, while possible, would mean not being able to visualize data on the frontend, which can be useful for saving computational power. In addition to state messages sent from the scene broadcaster to the client, the client can also make requests to the server using the user commands system (another backend plugin). It also utilizes the Gazebo Transport and Gazebo Messages libraries. The user commands system has services that can be requested by the frontend GUI to insert, delete, move (etc.) models, lights, and other entities, and will send responses back to the GUI acknowledging the receipt and execution of those requests. Several non-default plugins are able to send or receive messages to other processes outside of the server-client process. For example, the server-side sensors plugin publishes messages outside of the server-client process, and the server-side diff-drive plugin receives info from processes other than the client. One such process these plugins may communicate with, for example, is ROS. Frontend client process The client-side process, essentially the GUI, also comprises multiple plugins, some loaded by default, others that can be added, and all optional. All of the frontend plugins use the Gazebo GUI library. The client itself also relies on Gazebo GUI. There are visualization plugins that create the windows of the GUI, add buttons and other interactive features, and a 3D scene plugin that utilizes Gazebo Rendering that creates the scene the user sees. Frontend plugins typically communicate among themselves using events. Events are similar to messages, but they're processed synchronously. For example, the Render event is emitted by a 3D scene from it's rendering thread right before the scene is rendered; this gives other plugins the chance to execute code right at that thread at that moment, which is valuable to edit the 3D scene. Other such events are emitted when the user right-clicks or hovers the scene for example. Frontend plugins all have access to the entity and component information from the compressed message provided by the scene broadcaster system from the backend. The Entity Component Manager on the client side performs the actual message unpacking and distributes the entity and component information to the relevant plugins. This is how visualizations know how to update in accordance with backend computations. On the client side, the plugins are only reacting to the entity and component information, not interacting with it. As mentioned in the previous section, the GUI can send commands back to the server using the server’s user commands system. This would be the case, for example, if a user wanted to insert a new model through the GUI interface. User commands receives requests from the GUI and processes them, and adds those results to entities and components in the simulation loop.\"}\n",

Prerequisites Before beginning, you should have Ignition installed. If you installed from source you will need to source the workspace; otherwise, you\\'re good to go! Start by getting Ignition up and running with a sample world: ``bash ign gazebo shapes.sdf ` ign gazebo will run the latest version of Ignition you have installed. You can check if you have more than one version of Ignition installed by running ign gazebo --versions. For example, if you have Blueprint and Citadel installed, --versions might return: `bash 3.0.0 2.16.0 ` To ensure you\\'re working with Blueprint, include the --force-version directive when starting up: `bash ign gazebo --force-version 2.16.0 shapes.sdf ` GUI After running shapes.sdf, you should see the following screen: !shapes.sdf The interface consists of several sections: The Toolbar The orange toolbar along the top of the GUI contains two buttons, a file menu button on the left (horizontal stripes), and a plugins button on the right (vertical ellipsis). The file menu button allows you to save the world to a file, save and load interface configurations and customize interface style settings. An interface configuration consists of the plugins you have loaded and the style settings in place. The plugins button lists all the available plugins. You can scroll down this list to see all the plugins that are available for your version of Ignition. When you select one, its interface will appear in the right panel. The Right Panel shapes.sdf contains three plugins that you see in the right panel upon starting. At the top is the Entity Tree, followed by the Component Inspector, and then Transform Control. Everything in a simulation is considered an \"entity.\" In shapes.sdf, the entities listed are the ground plane, each of the shape models, and the sun. Items in the list can be expanded to reveal their links, as well as corresponding visuals and collisions, and joints, if they exist. You can select entities in the simulation by clicking on their names in the entity tree. You can also hold Ctrl and click to select multiple. !Selecting multiple entities from the entity tree You can also right-click on any plugin to open basic Settings or to Close. The Scene Within the scene is where you\\'ll interact with your simulated world and objects. Currently, you can navigate the scene with a mouse in several ways: Left-click: select entity Right-click: opens menu with options: Move to: center the scene on an entity Follow: choose an entity for the view to stay centered on, whether it moves or you pan around Remove: erase the entity from the simulation Left-click and drag: pan around the scene Right-click and drag: zoom in and out Scroll wheel forward/backward: zoom in and out Scroll wheel click and drag**: rotate the scene More complex methods for interacting with the entities within a scene will be explained in-depth in the coming tutorials. World Control Along the bottom edge of the scene, you\\'ll notice several buttons: !Playback buttons From left to right, the options are Play, Steps and RTF (real time factor). Pressing Play will start the simulation. You can use the same button to pause the simulation as well. The Steps button allows you to step through the simulation at the rate of a step size, or simulation iteration. You can customize step size by hovering over the button. At the furthest right end of the scene, you can expand RTF` to see not only the percentage value that compares real time with sim time, but also those individual values themselves, as well as iteration count. The function of the World Control options will become clearer once you begin manipulating entities. Next Up Now that you\\'re comfortable with Ignition GUI navigation and terminology, let\\'s start learning about more meaningful model interactions with the Manipulating Models tutorial.'}\n",

The Transform Control plugin is a combination of keybindings and transform control options: selection, translation, rotation and custom snap values. This chart of Ignition\\'s keyboard shortcuts may be helpful for this tutorial. The View Angle plugin allows you to quickly and easily adjust the direction from which your scene faces an entity in the simulation. The Component Inspector plugin displays a variety of object attributes. Prerequisites Start by getting Ignition up and running with a sample world: ``bash ign gazebo shapes.sdf ` The previous tutorial, Understanding the GUI, explains the basics of navigating the Ignition GUI. Transform Control The shapes.sdf file contains the Transform Control plugin, which is why the plugin is already at the bottom of the screen when you start. If you wanted to use the plugin in a world where it isn\\'t already included, you would open the plugin drop-down menu and select it from the list: !Choosing Transform Control from the plugin list Select Mode Selection is the default mode. You can click to select entities in the scene. A selected entity will be highlighted to indicate its selection. You can select multiple entities by holding Ctrl and clicking. !Selecting multiple entities Entities can\\'t be manipulated in select mode. You can always return to selection mode from any other mode by pressing Esc. Translate Mode Enter into translate mode by clicking the second icon from the left in the Transform Control plugin, or by hitting the keyboard shortcut: T. !Translate mode icon Translate mode allows you to translate entities along the x, y and z axes. Click on any entity while in translate mode to see the arrows representing the axes you can move along. The red arrow represents the x-axis, green the y-axis, and blue the z-axis. It\\'s easy to remember if you think \"XYZ - RGB.\" Click and hold on any of the arrows while moving your mouse to move the entity in that direction. !Translate mode Additionally, holding down any one of the X, Y or Z keys, or a combination of them, while clicking and dragging will constrain the model\\'s movement along those axes, regardless of the direction you move your mouse or the axis arrow you select. Rotate Mode Enter into rotate mode by clicking the third icon from the left in the Transform Control plugin, or by hitting the keyboard shortcut: R. !Rotate mode icon Rotate mode allows you to rotate entities around the roll, pitch and yaw axes of rotation. Click on any entity while in rotate mode to see the circles representing the axes you can rotate along. The red circle represents roll, green is pitch, and blue is yaw. Click and hold on any of the circles while moving your mouse to rotate the entity around that axis. !Rotate mode Align to World frame An entity\\'s local axes can become unaligned from the world frame after rotation. If you would like to translate along the world frame axis, simply hold Shift. This isn\\'t a permanent realignment; you can move the entity while holding Shift, but once you let go it will return to it\\'s local translational frame. !World frame alignment - translation The same can be done for an entity\\'s local rotational frame. !World frame alignment - rotation Enter Custom Snap Values When translating or rotating, you can \"snap\" an entity\\'s movement to preset increments by holding Ctrl and then clicking and dragging. By default, the snap value is 1 meter for translation and 45° for rotation. Translational snaps will snap relative to the world frame, whereas rotational snaps will snap relative to the object\\'s current orientation. !Snap rotation You can customize snap values by clicking on the furthest-right magnet icon in the Transform Control plugin. !Custom snap values Try holding Shift and Ctrl simultaneously to snap a model along the world frame is if isn\\'t already aligned. Component Inspector The Component Inspector plugin is included in shapes.sdf. With this plugin, you can select an entity to display some of its attributes, including its pose, whether or not wind is acting on it, whether or not it\\'s static, and more. The plugin also displays the gravitational and magnetic fields of your world. Expanding the Pose attribute will show the coordinate values for a selected object. The values will update as the object is moved around (translated or rotated) while the simulation is running. !Updating pose values You can also pause the plugin so an object\\'s pose values don\\'t update in the inspector while the simulation is playing. Additionally, the Component Inspector can be locked on one object so you can open another Component Inspector to simultaneously observe another object. !Two Component Inspectors View Angle The View Angle plugin does not come pre-loaded with shapes.sdf`, so you will have to select it from the plugins button on the toolbar. You can choose which angle you want to view the scene from, relative to a selected entity or the world frame if no entity is selected. The home button will return you to the original view pose from when the scene was loaded. You can also select multiple entities to face simultaneously from each view angle. !View angle for multiple entities Next Up So far you\\'ve interacted with basic shape models to learn about Ignition\\'s GUI. It\\'s also possible to insert more detailed models from Ignition Fuel into the GUI. Check out the Model Insertion from Fuel tutorial to learn how.'}\n",

This page exists for archival purposes. Please refer to the latest supported version. Blueprint Installation Blueprint supports the following platforms: Ubuntu Bionic on amd64/i386 MacOS Mojave Gazebo currently only works in headless mode Windows support is still experimental although most of the packages should work as expected. There are no binaries for Windows at this moment. The ign-gazebo package is still not available for Windows, the installation should be done from source code. Blueprint Libraries The Blueprint collection is composed by many different Ignition libraries. The collection assures that all libraries all compatible and can be used together. | Library name | Version | | ------------------ |:-------------:| | ign-cmake | 2.x | | ign-common | 3.x | | ign-fuel-tools | 3.x | | ign-gazebo | 2.x | | ign-gui | 2.x | | ign-launch | 1.x | | ign-math | 6.x | | ign-msgs | 4.x | | ign-physics | 1.x | | ign-plugin | 1.x | | ign-rendering | 2.x | | ign-sensors | 2.x | | ign-tools | 0.x | | ign-transport | 7.x | | sdformat | 8.x | Option 1: Installation on Ubuntu Bionic All of the Blueprint binaries are hosted in the osrfoundation repository. To install all of them, the metapackage ignition-blueprint can be installed: ``bash sudo sh -c \\'echo \"deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable lsbrelease -cs main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list\\' wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add - sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install ignition-blueprint ` All libraries should be ready to use and the ign gazebo app ready to be executed. Option 2: Install on MacOS Mojave (10.14) All the Blueprint binaries are available in Mojave using the homebrew package manager. The homebrew tool can easily be installed using: `bash /bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\" ` After installing the homebrew package manager, Ignition Blueprint can be installed running: `bash brew tap osrf/simulation brew install ignition-blueprint ` All libraries should be ready to use and the ign gazebo app ready to be executed. Option 3: Source Installation (any platform) The use of some additional tools is recommended to help with the source compilation, although other ways of correctly getting and building the sources are also possible. Colcon supports python 3.5 (or higher) which is not the default option in some platforms (like Ubuntu Bionic). The python virtualenv could be a useful solution in cases where the default option can not be easily changed. Installing vcstool and colcon For getting the sources of all libraries the easiest way is to use vcstool. The tool is available from pip in all platforms: `bash pip install vcstool ` Since Ignition libraries use git for version control it must be available in the system for vcstool to work properly. In Ubuntu: `bash sudo apt-get install git ` To compile all the different libraries and ign-gazebo in the right order it is recommended to use colcon. The colcon tool is available in all platforms using pip (or pip3, if pip fails): `bash pip install -U colcon-common-extensions ` Use .deb packages in Ubuntu to install vcstool and colcon An alternative method is to use the .deb packages available on Debian or Ubuntu: `bash sudo sh -c \\'echo \"deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsbrelease -sc) main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list\\' sudo apt-get install curl if curl isn\\'t already installed curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add - sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install python3-vcstool python3-colcon-common-extensions git ` Getting the sources The instructions below use some UNIX commands to manage directories but the obvious alternatives on Windows should provide the same result. The first step would be to create a developer workspace in which vcstool and colcon can work. `bash mkdir -p ~/workspace/src cd ~/workspace/src ` All the sources of ignition-blueprint are declared in a yaml file. Download it to the workspace. `bash wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ignition-tooling/gazebodistro/master/collection-blueprint.yaml ` Use vcstool to automatically retrieve all the Ignition libraries sources from their repositories: `bash vcs import /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list\\' wget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add - sudo apt-get update ` As reference the command below will install all dependencies in Ubuntu Bionic: `bash sudo apt-get install cmake freeglut3-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libdart6-collision-ode-dev libdart6-dev libdart6-utils-urdf-dev libfreeimage-dev libgflags-dev libglew-dev libgts-dev libogre-1.9-dev libogre-2.1-dev libprotobuf-dev libprotobuf-dev libprotoc-dev libqt5core5a libswscale-dev libtinyxml2-dev libtinyxml-dev pkg-config protobuf-compiler python qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel qml-module-qt-labs-settings qml-module-qtquick2 qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-dialogs qml-module-qtquick-layouts qml-module-qtqml-models2 qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev ruby ruby-ronn uuid-dev libzip-dev libjsoncpp-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libyaml-dev libzmq3-dev libsqlite3-dev libwebsockets-dev swig ruby-dev -y ` Building the Ignition Libraries The Ignition Libraries require the following compilers on each platform: Ubuntu Bionic: gcc 8 MacOS Mojave: Xcode 10 Windows: Visual Studio 2017 Installing gcc version 8 on Ubuntu Bionic To install gcc version 8 on Ubuntu Bionic: `bash sudo apt-get install g++-8 ` Set gcc-8 and g++-8 to be the default compilers. `bash sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 800 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 --slave /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-8 ` At this point gcc and g++ should both report version 8. Test this with the following commands. `bash gcc -v g++ -v ` Building the colcon workspace Once the compiler and all the sources are in place it is time to compile them. Start the procedure by changing into the workspace and listing the packages recognized by colcon: `bash cd ~/workspace/ colcon list -g ` colcon should list the Ignition libraries with their interdependencies. If that is the case, then you are ready to build the whole set of libraries: `bash colcon build --merge-install ` If there are no errors, all the binaries should be ready to use. Using the workspace The workspace binaries are ready but every time that ign gazebo needs to be executed or third party code is going to be developed using the Ignition libraries, one command is needed: `bash . ~/workspace/install/localsetup.bash (or call ~/workspace/install/local_setup.bat on Windows) ` After running the command all paths for running apps or developing code will be set in the current shell. Troubleshooting Unable to create the rendering window If you\\'re getting errors like \"Unable to create the rendering window\", it could mean you\\'re using an old OpenGL version. Gazebo Sim uses the Ogre 2 rendering engine by default, which requires an OpenGL version higher than 3.3. This can be confirmed by checking the Ogre 2 logs at ~/.ignition/rendering/ogre2.log, which should have an error like: \"OGRE EXCEPTION(3:RenderingAPIException): OpenGL 3.3 is not supported. Please update your graphics card drivers.\" You can also check your OpenGL version running: glxinfo | grep \"OpenGL version\" You should be able to use Ogre 1 without any issues however. You can check if that\\'s working by running a world which uses Ogre 1 instead of Ogre 2, such as: ign gazebo -v 3 lights.sdf If that loads, you can continue to use Ignition with Ogre 1, just be sure to specify ogre in your SDF files instead of ogre2. To enable Ogre 2 support, you\\'ll need to update your computer\\'s OpenGL version. As suggested on the Ogre logs, this may require updating your graphics card drivers. The Ogre 2 debs from the osrfoundation repository are built from a fork of Ogre\\'s v2-1` branch with changes needed for deb packaging and allowing it to be co-installable with Ogre 1.x. The code can be found here: https://github.com/osrf/ogre-2.1-release'}\n",

Please update your code accordingly in order to avoid > adverse effects. rosignbridge to the rescue rosignbridge provides a network bridge which enables the exchange of messages between ROS 1 and Ignition Transport. Its support is limited to only certain message types. Please, read this README to verify if your message type is supported by the bridge. How to install rosignbridge Binary install The repository packages.osrfoundation.org hosts binary packages for Ubuntu Bionic. To install the binaries ``bash sudo sh -c \\'echo \"deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable lsbrelease -cs main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list\\' sudo apt-get install ros-ign-bridge ` Source install See the prerequisites and install section of the bridge documentation. This tutorial requires Ubuntu Bionic or newer. Assuming that you have ROS Melodic, you can install all dependencies with: `bash sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop ros-melodic-rqt-image-view libignition-common3-dev libignition-transport7-dev ` Run the bridge and exchange images In this example, we\\'re going to generate Ignition Transport images using Gazebo, that will be converted into ROS 1 images, and visualized with rqtviewer. First we start a ROS 1 roscore: `bash Shell A: . /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash roscore ` Then we start Gazebo. `bash Shell B: ign gazebo -r camerasensor.sdf ` Gazebo should be running and publishing images over the /camera topic. Let\\'s verify it: `bash Shell C: ign topic -l | grep \"^/camera\" /camera ` Then we start the parameter bridge with the previous topic. If you perform a from source installation, please source the setup.bash (not needed for binary packages): `bash Shell D: . ~/bridgews/install/setup.bash ` Run the bridge: `bash Shell D: rosrun rosignbridge parameterbridge /camera@sensormsgs/Image@ignition.msgs.Image ` Now we start the ROS 1 GUI: `bash Shell E: . /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash rqtimageview /camera ` You should see the current images in rqtimageview` which are coming from Gazebo (published as Ignition Msgs over Ignition Transport). The screenshot shows all the shell windows and their expected content (it was taken using ROS Melodic): !Ignition Transport images and ROS 1 rqt'}\n",

This process is called Continuous Integration, or CI. This document covers all the CI jobs that are available for Gazebo and how to interpret their results. This documentation assumes you have gone over the Contributing guide and therefore are familiar with: Opening pull requests Automated tests Test coverage Static code checking Branching (stable release branches and main) Building with cmake or colcon Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) check It\\'s also helpful to go over our Release guide to be familiar with: Supported platforms Stable, pre-release and nightly releases Binary releases like Debian Types of checks The main type of check that is performed by CI is compiling the code and running all automated tests. Some jobs may also run static checkers, add labels, check DCO and code coverage. All checks are visible at the bottom of a pull request, for example: !PR checks We use two platforms to run CI (Jenkins and GitHub Actions), each of them running different builds. Our Jenkins server is located at https://build.osrfoundation.org/. It runs builds for all supported operating systems. It also runs an ABI checker for all stable branches. GitHub actions run on GitHub\\'s servers. Currently, it builds Linux for all libraries, and macOS for some of them. Here\\'s a summary of all checks. Platform | Job name | OS | What does it do? | Where dependencies come from? --- | --- | --- | --- | --- Jenkins | -ci-prany-ubuntu-auto-amd64 | Ubuntu | Compile and run tests using CMake and Make | Stable binaries for stable branches, nightlies for main Jenkins | -ci-prany-homebrew-amd64 | macOS | Compile and run tests using CMake and Make | Homebrew binaries bottled from osrf/simulation tap Jenkins | -ci-prany-windows-amd64 | Windows (deprecated) | Compile and run tests using configure.bat scripts and CMake + Visual Studio directly | External dependencies from custom tarballs Jenkins | -pr-win | Windows | Compile and run tests using colcon | External dependencies from vcpkg, Gazebo dependencies built from source with colcon Jenkins | -abichecker-anytoany-ubuntuauto-amd64 | Ubuntu | Run ABI checker | Stable binaries Actions | Ubuntu CI / Ubuntu CI | Ubuntu Bionic and Focal | Compile and run tests using CMake and Make, run code checker and upload coverage results | Stable binaries for stable branches, nightlies for main Actions | DCO | - | Checks that all commits are signed correctly | - Actions | PR Collection Labeler | - | Adds collection labels (i.e. Blueprint, Citadel...) according to the target branch | - Actions | Ticket opened | - | Adds the pull request to the Core development board | - Actions | codecov/ | - | Checks that the test coverage hasn\\'t been reduced | - Notes: The ABI job isn\\'t triggered for the main branch, because that\\'s where it\\'s ok to break ABI. GitHub Actions jobs can have the pullrequest or push suffix: pullrequest: Runs when a pull request is open and subsequent pushes are made to it. push: Runs for every commit pushed to the official repository. These don\\'t run for forks. Pull requests from the official repository will have both push and pullrequest. Only the Bionic Action uploads coverage results to Codecov, so we have a single coverage result for each branch. There\\'s some overlap between Jenkins and Actions jobs for Ubuntu, but they have some differences. Some Jenkins jobs run with on GPU machines and provides a nice interface to introspect builds. On the other hand, Actions runs coverage and codecheck. For Linux CI, the choice of stable / pre-release / nightly dependencies on both Jenkins and Actions is defined in gzdev\\'s repository.yaml. For macOS CI, the dependencies and tarball / source branch of each package are specified in the Formula/.rb files. For Windows CI, the dependencies and source branch of each package are specified in .yaml files in the gazebo-tooling/gazebodistro repository. Required checks Some checks are marked as Required. This means the pull request can\\'t be merged unless that check is green. Ideally, all checks would be required. But known warnings, test failures and flaky tests often prevent us from marking them as required, otherwise no pull requests could be merged. Until these are addressed, some checks will need to be checked by hand when they fail, to see if those failures are unexpected. See this issue for what checks are required for each library. Interpreting results On the GitHub UI, checks can be: ✅: Passed, all good! 🟡: Pending, results haven\\'t been received yet. ❌: Failed, something is wrong. Depending on the library and on the build queue (from our Jenkins server), checks can be in a pending 🟡 state from a couple of minutes up to an entire day. If a build is in this state for too long, there may be some issue with infrastructure and the build didn\\'t run or didn\\'t report back. Failing builds ❌ usually require more investigation: If the build is Required, something is definitely wrong and must be fixed before merging the pull request. If the build is not required, investigation is needed to find out if the failure is pre-existing or if it is being introduced by the pull request. Clicking on the Details button of a failing build takes you to the build so that you can inspect it. Builds can fail for a variety of reasons, for example: The code failed to compile. This should never be accepted, even in non-required checks, and must be fixed. Jenkins: When there\\'s a compilation failure, the build is marked red 🔴. On the build\\'s page, click on Console Output then scroll until you find the compilation errors under the compiling section. Actions: When there\\'s a compilation failure, the build is marked red ❌. On the build logs, the compilation failure should be under the make collapsible. There are test failures. Test failures that aren\\'t pre-existing must be fixed. Jenkins: When there are test failures, the build is marked yellow 🟡. On the build\\'s page, the failing tests are listed under Test Result. Click on a test\\'s name, then on \"History\" on the left to see if the test has failed before. It\\'s often helpful to see the full test logs on Console Output. Actions: When there are test failures, the build is marked red ❌. On the build logs, the test failures should be under the make test collapsible. Check which tests are known failures by searching for the test name on issues. There are warnings. Warnings that aren\\'t pre-existing must be fixed. Jenkins: When there are warnings, the build is marked yellow 🟡. On the build\\'s page, the warnings are listed under GNU C Compiler and CMake. You can also check the Console Output for the full warning logs. Actions: Does not detect compiler or CMake warnings. There are static checker failures. All code checker failures must be fixed. Jenkins: Does not run static checkers. Actions: When there are code check failures, the build is marked red ❌. On the build logs, the checker failures should be under the Code check collapsible. There are infrastructure failures. Contributors should leave a comment on the pull request for maintainers, who will report these to the build farmer. Jenkins: When there\\'s an infra failure, the build is marked red 🔴. These can manifest in various ways. In general, if the build logs don\\'t fall in the categories above, there\\'s a high chance it\\'s an infrastructure failure. Common patterns usually have several java or hudson messages. Actions: Infrastructure failures haven\\'t been identified. Triggering CI CI is usually triggered automatically when code is pushed or a pull request is opened. But often it\\'s necessary to re-trigger CI without making changes to the code if: There were infrastructure failures in a previous build. There are fixes upstream, on infra or dependencies, that may make a new build pass. The following methods can be used by maintainers to re-trigger builds: Jenkins Make a comment starting with @osrf-jenkins run tests on the pull request and all Jenkins builds will be re-triggered. To restart just one specific build and avoid re-running builds that aren\\'t necessary, go to the failing build and click Retry in the Jenkins UI after login. Actions On the top-right of a build inside the \\'Actions\\' tab of GitHub, click Re-run jobs. Note that this button sometimes mysteriously disappears. Testing pull requests with custom tooling branches As noted above, the gzdev, homebrew-simulation, and gazebodistro tooling repositories each contain metadata about dependencies for each package on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows, respectively. If you wish to test a pull request with a custom branch of one of these tooling repositories, you can do this by creating branches with the same name that starts with cimatchingbranch/ on both the tooling repository and the repository to be tested. Example: testing with an additional dependency on macOS In gz-math#361, a fix for gz-math\\'s python bindings on macOS was proposed, but pybind11 was not yet a dependency of the gz-math homebrew formulae. To test this pull request with pybind11 installed in the macOS CI machines, identical branch names cimatchingbranch/mathscripting were used for gz-math#361 and homebrew-simulation#1793 which allowed the gz-math macOS CI build to include the new dependency. Example: testing with a source build of a custom branch of a dependency on macOS To determine whether changes in gz-math and sdformat were the cause of gz-sim test failures documented in osrf/buildfarm-tools#67 (comment), the gz-math8 and sdformat15 formulae were modified so that the primary url field contains the URL of their respective git repositories, along with a branch field indicating the branch name to be tested. The gz-math8 formula was modified to use the scpeters/revert606 branch (corresponding to gz-math#609), and the sdformat15 formula was modified to use the scpeters/revert1458 branch (corresponding to sdformat#1459). These changes to formulae were commited to the cimatchingbranch/revertmathgraphinit branch (see osrf/homebrew-simulation@6bdfaea6). To test gz-sim with these branches of gz-math and sdformat, a trivial change to the gz-sim README was made in a branch with matching name cimatchingbranch/revertmathgraphinit, and a draft pull request (gz-sim#2482) was opened to trigger CI builds. The homebrew build used the matching branch of homebrew-simulation and built against the intended branches. Custom branches Maintainers can manually trigger builds for custom branches without opening pull requests, optionally building dependencies from source and changing other configurations for testing. One possible reason to trigger CI with custom dependency branches is testing changes across repositories. For example, if your ign-gazebo pull request needs a change from ign-physics, you could build a custom branch of ign-physics from source to check it works with ign-gazebo on CI before even opening an ign-physics pull request, or making a release. Actions By default, builds are run for every commit based on configuration inside the .github/ci directory. So it\\'s possible to change the contents of that directory and immediately see updated CI results when you push commits. See the documentation on action-gz-ci to see what can be configured and how. Be sure to revert these changes before merging the pull request. Jenkins The prany jobs can be triggered manually for any branch by maintainers. Go to the job\\'s page, for example gzlaunch-ci-prany-ubuntuauto-amd64, click on Build with Parameters to trigger a new build (beware of this issue and use this carefully). There are 2 things you\\'ll want to configure before triggering a build: sha1: this is the custom branch you want to build, prefixed by origin/. RTOOLSBRANCH: a branch in release-tools that contains custom configuration. For example, see this change for building a custom ign-rendering branch on this ign-sensors pull request. If you want to share the status of your custom build on a pull request, click on Embeddable Build Status and copy the markdown code into the pull request. Manually triggered from source jobs The CI view in Jenkins contains different jobs generated designed to build all the Gazebo libraries in a releases from source using the build tools: vcs (tool to grab sources, mainly with the yaml files at gazebodistro repository and colcon (build tool). The CI view in Jenkins contains different jobs: Separated by ubuntu distro. i.e: cicolconany-manualubuntujammyamd64 or cicolconany-manualubuntunobleamd64 for jammy and noble. Separated to be run on GPU or not: cicolcongpuany-manualubuntujammyamd64 in gpu or cicolconany-manualubuntujammyamd64 to not use gpu. Parameters in the CI jobs (most important ones): reposfileurls: typically a VCS yaml file defining the sources to be built. Default can be modified to build any Gazebo collection or any Gazebo package starting from Harmonic. Typical value is one of the raw files at gazebodistro repository . buildtoolargs: colcon build parameters to use. Default can be preserve but, unless the whole list of packages defined in reposfileurls is to be built, a set of packages needs to defined. For example, to build all packages needed until gz-tranport8, --packages-up-to gz-transport8 can be added to the default options. buildtooltestargs: colcon test parameters to use. Default can be preserve but, unless the whole list of tests of all packages defined in reposfileurls is to be run, a set of packages needs to be defined to be the software under test. For example, to run only gz-transport8 tests, the --packages-select gz-transport8 can be added to the default options. Development All the infrastructure for our CI is in the gazebo-tooling organization. Most of the stuff running in Jenkins is in release-tools. The GitHub action is in action-gz-ci.'}\n",

Prerequisites Before beginning, you should have Ignition installed. If you installed from source you will need to source the workspace; otherwise, you\\'re good to go! Start by getting Ignition up and running with a sample world: ``bash ign gazebo shapes.sdf ` ign gazebo will run the latest version of Ignition you have installed. You can check if you have more than one version of Ignition installed by running ign gazebo --versions. For example, if you have Blueprint and Citadel installed, --versions might return: `bash 3.0.0 2.16.0 ` To ensure you\\'re working with Citadel, include the --force-version directive when starting up: `bash ign gazebo --force-version 3.0.0 shapes.sdf ` GUI After running shapes.sdf, you should see the following screen: !shapes.sdf The interface consists of several sections: The Toolbar The orange toolbar along the top of the GUI contains two buttons, a file menu button on the left (horizontal stripes), and a plugins button on the right (vertical ellipsis). The file menu button allows you to save the world to a file, save and load interface configurations and customize interface style settings. An interface configuration consists of the plugins you have loaded and the style settings in place. The top left toolbar hanging below the file menu button contains transform control (first four buttons) and shape buttons (sphere, box, cylinder). To learn more about transform control, go to the \"Transform Control\" section of Manipulating Models tutorial. The shape buttons allow you to directly insert box, sphere or cylinder model into the world. Simply click on the shape you would like to insert, and place it into the world. The shape will automatically snap onto the ground plane, and its properties will show up on the Entity Tree plugin window. The following is what it looks like after inserting shapes: !shape insertion The plugins button lists all the available plugins. You can scroll down this list to see all the plugins that are available for your version of Ignition. When you select one, its interface will appear in the right panel. The Right Panel shapes.sdf contains three plugins that you see in the right panel upon starting. At the top is the Entity Tree, followed by the Component Inspector, and then Transform Control. Everything in a simulation is considered an \"entity.\" In shapes.sdf, the entities listed are the ground plane, each of the shape models, and the sun. Items in the list can be expanded to reveal their links, as well as corresponding visuals and collisions, and joints, if they exist. You can select entities in the simulation by clicking on their names in the entity tree. You can also hold Ctrl and click to select multiple. !Selecting multiple entities from the entity tree You can also right-click on any plugin to open basic Settings or to Close. The Scene Within the scene is where you\\'ll interact with your simulated world and objects. Currently, you can navigate the scene with a mouse in several ways: Left-click: select entity Right-click: opens menu with options: Move to: center the scene on an entity Follow: choose an entity for the view to stay centered on, whether it moves or you pan around Remove: erase the entity from the simulation Left-click and drag: pan around the scene Right-click and drag: zoom in and out Scroll wheel forward/backward: zoom in and out Scroll wheel click and drag**: rotate the scene More complex methods for interacting with the entities within a scene will be explained in-depth in the coming tutorials. Grid Config The grid visible in the scene can be adjusted by a plugin. You can adjust features of the world\\'s grid, including cell size, grid position, cell count, and even color. Open the the Grid Config plugin by selecting it from the plugins button from the toolbar and selecting it from the dropdown list. !Select Grid Config World Control Along the bottom edge of the scene, you\\'ll notice several buttons: !Playback buttons From left to right, the options are Play, Steps and RTF (real time factor). Pressing Play will start the simulation. You can use the same button to pause the simulation as well. The Steps button allows you to step through the simulation at the rate of a step size, or simulation iteration. You can customize step size by hovering over the button. At the furthest right end of the scene, you can expand RTF` to see not only the percentage value that compares real time with sim time, but also those individual values themselves, as well as iteration count. The function of the World Control options will become clearer once you begin manipulating entities. Next Up Now that you\\'re comfortable with Ignition GUI navigation and terminology, let\\'s start learning about more meaningful model interactions with the Manipulating Models tutorial.'}\n",

The Transform Control plugin is a combination of keybindings and transform control options: selection, translation, rotation and custom snap values. This chart of Ignition\\'s keyboard shortcuts may be helpful for this tutorial. The View Angle plugin allows you to quickly and easily adjust the direction from which your scene faces an entity in the simulation. The Component Inspector plugin displays a variety of object attributes. The Align Tool aligns entities with the center/origin of other entities. Prerequisites Start by getting Ignition up and running with a sample world: ``bash ign gazebo shapes.sdf ` The previous tutorial, Understanding the GUI, explains the basics of navigating the Ignition GUI. Transform Control The shapes.sdf file contains the Transform Control plugin, which is why the plugin is already at the bottom of the screen when you start. If you wanted to use the plugin in a world where it isn\\'t already included, you would open the plugin drop-down menu and select it from the list: !Choosing Transform Control from the plugin list Select Mode Selection is the default mode. You can click to select entities in the scene. A selected entity will be highlighted to indicate its selection. You can select multiple entities by holding Ctrl and clicking. !Selecting multiple entities Entities can\\'t be manipulated in select mode. You can always return to selection mode from any other mode by pressing Esc. Translate Mode Enter into translate mode by clicking the second icon from the left in the Transform Control plugin, or by hitting the keyboard shortcut: T. !Translate mode icon Translate mode allows you to translate entities along the x, y and z axes. Click on any entity while in translate mode to see the arrows representing the axes you can move along. The red arrow represents the x-axis, green the y-axis, and blue the z-axis. Click and hold on any of the arrows while moving your mouse to move the entity in that direction. !Translate mode Additionally, holding down any one of the X, Y or Z keys, or a combination of them, while clicking and dragging will constrain the model\\'s movement along those axes, regardless of the direction you move your mouse or the axis arrow you select. Rotate Mode Enter into rotate mode by clicking the third icon from the left in the Transform Control plugin, or by hitting the keyboard shortcut: R. !Rotate mode icon Rotate mode allows you to rotate entities around the roll, pitch and yaw axes of rotation. Click on any entity while in rotate mode to see the circles representing the axes you can rotate along. The red circle represents roll, green is pitch, and blue is yaw. Click and hold on any of the circles while moving your mouse to rotate the entity around that axis. !Rotate mode Align to World frame An entity\\'s local axes can become unaligned from the world frame after rotation. If you would like to translate along the world frame axis, simply hold Shift. This isn\\'t a permanent realignment; you can move the entity while holding Shift, but once you let go it will return to it\\'s local translational frame. !World frame alignment - translation The same can be done for an entity\\'s local rotational frame. !World frame alignment - rotation Enter Custom Snap Values When translating or rotating, you can \"snap\" an entity\\'s movement to preset increments by holding Ctrl and then clicking and dragging. By default, the snap value is 1 meter for translation and 45° for rotation. Translational snaps will snap relative to the world frame, whereas rotational snaps will snap relative to the object\\'s current orientation. !Snap rotation You can customize snap values by clicking on the furthest-right magnet icon in the Transform Control plugin. !Custom snap values Try holding Shift and Ctrl simultaneously to snap a model along the world frame is if isn\\'t already aligned. Component Inspector The Component Inspector plugin is included in shapes.sdf. With this plugin, you can select an entity to display some of its attributes, including its pose, whether or not wind is acting on it, whether or not it\\'s static, and more. The plugin also displays the gravitational and magnetic fields of your world. Expanding the Pose attribute will show the coordinate values for a selected object. The values will update as the object is moved around (translated or rotated) while the simulation is running. !Updating pose values You can also pause the plugin so an object\\'s pose values don\\'t update in the inspector while the simulation is playing. Additionally, the Component Inspector can be locked on one object so you can open another Component Inspector to simultaneously observe another object. !Two Component Inspectors View Angle The View Angle plugin does not come pre-loaded with shapes.sdf, so you will have to select it from the plugins button on the toolbar. You can choose which angle you want to view the scene from, relative to a selected entity or the world frame if no entity is selected. The home button will return you to the original view pose from when the scene was loaded. You can also select multiple entities to face simultaneously from each view angle. !View angle for multiple entities Align Tool Like the View Angle plugin, the Align Tool is also not pre-loaded and will also have to be selected from the plugins button on the toolbar. The Align Tool aligns a model up with the center/origin of another model, or with something besides a model, like a link for example. It can\\'t, however, align a link or anything other than the top-level model up with something else. With Relative to First selected, select two models using Ctrl + click to see the second model align to the first along either it\\'s x, y or z axis. Hovering over the buttons for each axis will show a preview of where the model would end up if aligned along that axis. You can align more than two models, just select the others with Ctrl` + click. !Align tool Next Up So far you\\'ve interacted with basic shape models to learn about Ignition\\'s GUI. It\\'s also possible to insert more detailed models from Ignition Fuel into the GUI. Check out the Model Insertion from Fuel tutorial to learn how.'}\n",

      "{'_id': ObjectId('674fc48d420c5b5d2de0e531'), 'file_name': 'actors.md', 'source': 'GitHub', 'repo': 'gazebo_simulation', 'file_url': 'https://github.com/gazebosim/docs/blob/master/citadel/actors.md', 'content': \"Actors In this tutorial we will learn how to add actors to our world and how to create a scripted animation. You can find the final world of this tutorial here. Animations are very useful if we want to have entities following a predefined path in simulation without being affected by the physics. This means that they won't fall due to gravity or collide with other objects. They will however, have a 3D visualization which can be seen by RGB cameras, and 3D meshes which can be detected by GPU based sensors. The tutorial explains how to create open-loop trajectories which don't interact with the rest of the simulation. Actors In Gazebo Sim, an animated model is called an actor. There are two types of animations which can be used separately or combined together: Skeleton animation, which is relative motion between links in one model: !skeletonmovement Trajectory animation, which carries all of the actor's links around the world as one group along a trajectory: !trajectorymovement Combined, to achieve a skeleton animation which moves in the world: !combinedmovement Actors have the following properties: No forces are applied on them, be it from gravity or contact or anything else Actors support skeleton animation imported from COLLADA (.dae) and BVH (.bvh) files. Actors can have trajectories scripted directly in SDF. You can check out the full specification for the SDF element here. Skeleton Gazebo Sim supports two different skeleton animation file formats: COLLADA (.dae) and Biovision Hierarchy (.bvh). Open any world, empty.sdf world for example, and add an actor called actorwalking as follows: ``xml https://fuel.ignitionrobotics.org/1.0/Mingfei/models/actor/tip/files/meshes/walk.dae 1.0 https://fuel.ignitionrobotics.org/1.0/Mingfei/models/actor/tip/files/meshes/walk.dae ` Skin In the tag we just loaded a COLLADA file walk.dae which specifies how our actor will look. When a COLLADA file is used within the tags its animation is loaded. The scales the skin's size. Animation In the tag we specify how our actor will move. We can combine different skins with different animations as long as they have compatible skeletons. Now run the world and we should see our model moving. !actor loaded with skin tag Note: You can find many actors and models on Ignition Fuel. Scripted trajectory This is the high level animation of actors, which consists of specifying a series of poses to be reached at specific times. Gazebo Sim takes care of interpolating the motion between them so the movement is fluid. Animations that have displacement on the X axis, like walk.dae, will have the skeleton animated while following a trajectory. But for animations that don't, such as talkb.dae, their skeletons won't move if there's a trajectory. We can make our actor follow the specified trajectory forever and start playing as soon as the world is loaded as follows: `xml true 0.000000 true ` The script is defined between the tags. Inside the tag the following parameters are available: loop: Set this to true for the script to be repeated in a loop. For a fluid continuous motion, make sure the last waypoint matches the first one, as we will do. delaystart: This is the time in seconds to wait before starting the script. If running in a loop, this time will be waited before starting each cycle. autostart: Set to true if the animation should start as soon as the simulation starts playing. It is useful to set this to false if the animation should start playing only when triggered by a plugin, for example. Let's define the trajectory as a sequence of waypoints: `xml 0 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 2 2.0 0 1.0 0 0 0 2.5 2 0 1.0 0 0 1.57 4 2 2 1.0 0 0 1.57 4.5 2 2 1.0 0 0 3.142 6 0 2 1 0 0 3.142 6.5 0 2 1 0 0 -1.57 8 0 0 1.0 0 0 -1.57 8.5 0 0 1.0 0 0 0 ` Within the tag we define a series of waypoints which our actor will follow. The has two attributes: id and type. The type should have the same name as the animation walk. Under the trajectory tag we define the following: waypoint: There can be any number of waypoints in a trajectory. Each waypoint consists of a time and a pose: time: The time in seconds, counted from the beginning of the script, when the pose should be reached. pose`: The pose which should be reached with respect to the initial actor pose. Run the world and we should see our actor moving in a square following the waypoints. !actormoving around Notes: The order in which waypoints are defined is not important, they will follow the given times. The trajectory is smoothed as a whole. This means that you'll get a fluid motion, but the exact poses contained in the waypoints might not be reached. Now it's your turn! Try out different trajectory descriptions. Video walk-through A video walk-through of this tutorial is available from our YouTube channel: Ignition tutorials: Animated human actors\"}\n",

We will build a simple two wheeled robot. You can find the finished SDF file for the tutorial here. What is SDF SDFormat (Simulation Description Format), sometimes abbreviated as SDF, is an XML format that describes objects and environments for robot simulators, visualization, and control. Building a world We will start by building a simple world and then build our robot in it. Open a new file and copy the following code to it. ``xml 0.001 1.0 3D View false docked ogre2 scene 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.8 0.8 0.8 World control false false 72 121 1 floating true true true /world/carworld/control /world/carworld/stats World stats false false 110 290 1 floating true true true true /world/carworld/stats true 0 0 10 0 0 0 0.8 0.8 0.8 1 0.2 0.2 0.2 1 1000 0.9 0.01 0.001 -0.5 0.1 -0.9 true 0 0 1 0 0 1 100 100 0.8 0.8 0.8 1 0.8 0.8 0.8 1 0.8 0.8 0.8 1 ` Save the file, navigate to the directory where you saved the file and launch the simulator: ign gazebo buildingrobot.sdf Note: You can name your file any name and save it anywhere on your computer. You should see an empty world with just a ground plane and a sun light. Check World demo to learn how to build your own world. Building a model Under the tag we will add our robot model as follows: Defining the model `xml 0 0 0 0 0 0 ` Here we define the name of our model vehicleblue, which should be a unique name among its siblings (other tags or models on the same level). Each model may have one link designated as the canonicallink, the implicit frame of the model is attached to this link. If not defined, the first will be chosen as the canonical link. The tag is used to define the position and orientation of our model and the relativeto attribute is used to define the pose of the model relative to any other frame. If relativeto is not defined, the model's will be relative to the world. Let's make our pose relative to the world. The values inside the pose tag are as follows: X Y Z R P Y, where the X Y Z represent the position of the frame and R P Y represent the orientation in roll pitch yaw. We set them to zeros which makes the two frames (the model and the world) identical. Links forming our robot Every model is a group of links (can be just one link) connected together with joints. Chassis `xml 0.5 0 0.4 0 0 0 ` We define the first link, the chassis of our car and it's pose relative to the model. Inertial properties `xml 1.14395 0.095329 0 0 0.381317 0 0.476646 ` Here we define the inertial properties of the chassis like the mass and the matrix. The values of the inertia matrix for primitive shapes can be calculated using this tool. Visual and collision `xml 2.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 0.0 1.0 1 0.0 0.0 1.0 1 0.0 0.0 1.0 1 ` As the name suggests, the tag is responsible for how our link will look. We define the shape of our link inside the tag as a (cuboid) and then specify the three dimensions (in meters) of this box inside the tag. Then, inside the tag we define the material of our link. Here we defined the , and colors in a set of four numbers red/green/blue/alpha each in range [0, 1]. `xml 2.0 1.0 0.5 ` The tag defines the collision properties of the link, how our link will react with other objects and the effect of the physics engine on it. Note: can be different from the visual properties, for example, simpler collision models are often used to reduce computation time. After copying all the parts above into the world file in order, run the world again: ign gazebo buildingrobot.sdf Our model should look like this: !car chassis In the top right corner click on the plugins dropdown list (vertical ellipsis), choose Transform control, select your model and then click on the Translation tool. You should see three axes like this: !modelaxis These are the axes of our model where red is the x-axis, green is the y-axis and blue is the z-axis. Left wheel Let's add wheels to our robot. The following code goes after the tag and before the tag. All the links and joints belonging to the same model should be defined before the . `xml -0.5 0.6 0 -1.5707 0 0 1 0.043333 0 0 0.043333 0 0.08 ` We defined the name of our link leftwheel and then defined its relativeto the chassis link. The wheel needed to be placed on the left to the back of the chassis so that's why we chose the values for pose as -0.5 0.6 0. Also, our wheel is a cylinder, but on its side. That's why we defined the orientation value as -1.5707 0 0 which is a -90 degree rotation around the x-axis (the angles are in radians). Then we defined the inertial properties of the wheel, the mass and the inertia matrix. Visualization and Collision `xml 0.4 0.2 1.0 0.0 0.0 1 1.0 0.0 0.0 1 1.0 0.0 0.0 1 0.4 0.2 ` The and the properties are similar to the previous link, except the shape of our link has the shape of that requires two attributes: the and the of the cylinder. Save the file and run the world again, our model should look like this: !this Right wheel `xml -0.5 -0.6 0 -1.5707 0 0 1 0.043333 0 0 0.043333 0 0.08 0.4 0.2 1.0 0.0 0.0 1 1.0 0.0 0.0 1 1.0 0.0 0.0 1 0.4 0.2 ` The right wheel is similar to the left wheel except for its position. Defining an arbitrary frame One of the new features of SDF 1.7 is that we can define arbitrary frames. It takes two attributes: name: the name of the frame attachedto: the name of the frame or the link to which this frame is attached. Let's add a frame for our caster wheel as follows: `xml 0.8 0 -0.2 0 0 0 ` We gave our frame name casterframe and attached it to the chassis link, then the tag to define the position and orientation of the frame. We didn't use the relativeto attribute so the pose is with respect to the frame named in the attachedto attribute, chassis in our case. Caster wheel `xml 1 0.016 0 0 0.016 0 0.016 0.2 0.0 1 0.0 1 0.0 1 0.0 1 0.0 1 0.0 1 0.2 ` Our last link is the caster and its pose is with respect to the frame casterframe we defined above. As you could notice we closed the pose tag without defining the position or the orientation; in this case the pose of the link is the same as (identity) the frame in relativeto. In the and tags we defined a different shape which requires the of the sphere. Connecting links together (joints) We need to connect these links together; here comes the job of the tag. The joint tag connects two links together and defines how they will move with respect to each other. Inside the tag we need to define the two links to connect and their relations(way of movement). Left wheel joint `xml ` Our first joint is the leftwheeljoint. It takes two attributes: the name name='leftwheeljoint' and the type type='revolute'. the revolute type gives 1 rotational degree of freedom with joint limits. The pose of the joint is the same as the child link frame, which is the leftwheel frame. `xml chassis leftwheel ` Every joint connects two links (bodies) together. Here we connect the chassis with the leftwheel. chassis is the parent link and leftwheel is the child link. `xml 0 1 0 -1.79769e+308 1.79769e+308 ` Here we define the axis of rotation. The axis of rotation can be any frame, not just the parent or the child link. We chose the y-axis with respect to the model frame so we put 1 in the y element and zeros in the others. For the revolute joint we need to define the of our rotation angle in the and tags. Note: The angles are in radians. Right wheel joint The rightwheeljoint is very similar except for the pose of the joint. This joint connects the rightwheel with the chassis. `xml chassis rightwheel 0 1 0 -1.79769e+308 1.79769e+308 ` Caster wheel joint For the caster we need a different type of joint (connection). We used type='ball' which gives 3 rotational degrees of freedom. `xml chassis caster ` Conclusion Run the world: ign gazebo buildingrobot.sdf` It should look like this: !twowheeledrobot Hurray! We build our first robot. You can learn more details about SDFormat tags here. In the next tutorial we will learn how to move our robot around.

The following tools are required to be installed on the host machine: 1. git - If not already installed consider Ubuntu Binary Install 2. Docker - If not already installed consider Ubuntu Source Install 3. gzdev - ignition-tooling/gzdev 4. vcstool - dirk-thomas/vcstool Using gzdev ign-docker-env Detailed instructions are available in the gzdev repository. High level instructions: 1. Create a workspace with the source to mount into a container using vcstool 2. Use gzdev ign-docker-env to build and start a container with --vol pointing to the previously created workspace 3. See Ubuntu Source Install section on building for instructions to work with a source install 4. Consider Contributing Troubleshooting See Troubleshooting'}\n",
