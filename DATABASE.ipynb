Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this\\n          Public License.\\n\\n       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\\n          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed\\n          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society\\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory\\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\\n          reserves any right to collect such royalties.\\n\\n\\nSection 3 -- License Conditions.\\n\\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the\\nfollowing conditions.\\n\\n  a. Attribution.\\n\\n       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified\\n          form), You must:\\n\\n            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\\n               with the Licensed Material:\\n\\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed\\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\\n                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\\n                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if\\n                    designated);\\n\\n                ii. a copyright notice;\\n\\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;\\n\\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\\n                    warranties;\\n\\n                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\\n                    extent reasonably practicable;\\n\\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and\\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and\\n\\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\\n               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\\n               hyperlink to, this Public License.\\n\\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any\\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in\\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\\n          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\\n          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required\\n          information.\\n\\n       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\\n          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\\n          reasonably practicable.\\n\\n       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter\\'s\\n          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\\n          Material from complying with this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\\n\\nWhere the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\\napply to Your use of the Licensed Material:\\n\\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right\\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\\n     portion of the contents of the database;\\n\\n  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database\\n     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database\\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and\\n\\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\\n     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\\n\\nFor the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\\nreplace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed\\nRights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.\\n\\n\\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\\n\\n  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\\n     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR\\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\\n     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\\n     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\\n     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,\\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\\n     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\\n     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\\n     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\\n\\n  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\\n     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\\n     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and\\n     waiver of all liability.\\n\\n\\nSection 6 -- Term and Termination.\\n\\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and\\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with\\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\\n     terminate automatically.\\n\\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under\\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\\n\\n       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided\\n          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the\\n          violation; or\\n\\n       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.\\n\\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any\\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations\\n     of this Public License.\\n\\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the\\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop\\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so\\n     will not terminate this Public License.\\n\\n  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\\n     License.\\n\\n\\nSection 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.\\n\\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different\\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\\n\\n  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\\n     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and\\n     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.\\n\\n\\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\\n\\n  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\\n     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\\n     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\\n     be made without permission under this Public License.\\n\\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is\\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the\\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\\n     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\\n     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\\n     conditions.\\n\\n  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\\n     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\\n     Licensor.\\n\\n  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\\n     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\\n     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal\\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\\n\\n\\n=======================================================================\\n\\nCreative Commons is not a party to its public\\nlicenses.

system\\n================\\n\\n.. contents:: Table of Contents\\n   :local:\\n\\n.. include:: ../../../global_substitutions.txt\\n\\nThe build system is what allows developers to build their ROS 2 code as needed.\\nROS 2 relies heavily on the division of code into packages, with each package containing a manifest file (``package.xml``).\\nThis manifest file contains essential metadata about the package, including its dependencies on other packages.\\nThis manifest is required for the meta-build tool to function.\\n\\nThe ROS 2 build system consists of 3 major concepts.\\n\\nBuild tool\\n----------\\n\\nThis is the software that controls the compilation and testing of a single package.\\nIn ROS 2 this is usually CMake for C++, and setuptools for Python, but other build tools are supported.\\n\\nBuild helpers\\n-------------\\n\\nThese are helper functions that hook into the build tool to developer experience.\\nROS 2 packages typically rely on the ``ament`` series of packages for this.\\n``ament`` consists of a few important repositories which are all in the `GitHub organization <https://github.com/ament>`_.\\n\\nThe ``ament_package`` package\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nLocated on |GitHub|_ at `ament/ament_package <https://github.com/ament/ament_package>`_, this repository contains a single :term:`ament Python package` that provides various utilities for |ament packages|, e.g. templates for environment hooks.\\n\\nAll |ament packages| must contain a single :term:`package.xml` file at the root of the package regardless of their underlying build system.\\nThe :term:`package.xml` \"manifest\" file contains information that is required in order to process and operate on a |package|.\\nThis |package| information includes things like the |package|\\'s name, which is globally unique, and the package\\'s dependencies.\\nThe :term:`package.xml` file also serves as the marker file which indicates the location of the |package| on the file system.\\n\\nParsing of the :term:`package.xml` files is provided by ``catkin_pkg`` (as in ROS 1), while functionality to locate |packages| by searching the file system for these :term:`package.xml` files is provided by build tools such as ``colcon``.\\n\\n.. glossary::\\n\\n   package.xml\\n       Package manifest file which marks the root of a :term:`package` and contains meta information about the :term:`package` including its name, version, description, maintainer, license, dependencies, and more.\\n       The contents of the manifest are in machine readable XML format and the contents are described in the |REPs| `127 <http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0127.html>`_ and `140 <http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0140.html>`_, with the possibility of further modifications in future |REPs|.\\n\\nSo anytime some |package| is referred to as an :term:`ament package`, it means that it is a single unit of software (source code, build files, tests, documentation, and other resources) which is described using a :term:`package.xml` manifest file.\\n\\n.. glossary::\\n\\n   ament package\\n       Any |package| which contains a :term:`package.xml` and follows the packaging guidelines of ``ament``, regardless of the underlying build system.\\n\\nSince the term :term:`ament package` is build system agnostic, there can be different kinds of |ament packages|, e.g. :term:`ament CMake package`, :term:`ament Python package`, etc.\\n\\nHere is a list of common package types that you might run into in this software stack:\\n\\n.. glossary::\\n\\n    CMake package\\n        Any |package| containing a plain CMake project and a :term:`package.xml` manifest file.\\n\\n    ament CMake package\\n        A :term:`CMake package` that also follows the ``ament`` packaging guidelines.\\n\\n    Python package\\n        Any |package| containing a `setuptools <https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/>`_ based Python project and a :term:`package.xml` manifest file.\\n\\n    ament Python package\\n        A :term:`Python package` that also follows the ``ament`` packaging guidelines.\\n\\nThe ``ament_cmake`` repository\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nLocated on |GitHub|_ at `ament/ament_cmake <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake>`_, this repository contains many \"ament CMake\" and pure CMake packages which provide the infrastructure in CMake that is required to create \"ament CMake\" packages.\\nIn this context \"ament CMake\" packages means: ``ament`` packages that are built using CMake.\\nSo the |packages| in this repository provide the necessary CMake functions/macros and CMake Modules to facilitate creating more \"ament CMake\" (or ``ament_cmake``) packages.\\nPackages of this type are identified with the ``<build_type>ament_cmake</build_type>`` tag in the ``<export>`` tag of the :term:`package.xml` file.\\n\\nThe |packages| in this repository are extremely modular, but there is a single \"bottleneck\" |package| called ``ament_cmake``.\\nAnyone can depend on the ``ament_cmake`` |package| to get all of the aggregate functionality of the |packages| in this repository.\\nHere a list of the |packages| in the repository along with a short description:\\n\\n-  ``ament_cmake``\\n\\n   - aggregates all other |packages| in this repository, users need only to depend on this\\n\\n-  ``ament_cmake_auto``\\n\\n   - provides convenience CMake functions which automatically handle a lot of the tedious parts of writing a |package|\\'s ``CMakeLists.txt`` file\\n\\n-  ``ament_cmake_core``\\n\\n   - provides all built-in core concepts for ``ament``, e.g. environment hooks, resource indexing, symbolic linking install and others\\n\\n-  ``ament_cmake_gmock``\\n\\n   - adds convenience functions for making gmock based unit tests\\n\\n-  ``ament_cmake_gtest``\\n\\n   - adds convenience functions for making gtest based automated tests\\n\\n-  ``ament_cmake_nose``\\n\\n   - adds convenience functions for making nosetests based python automated tests\\n\\n-  ``ament_cmake_python``\\n\\n   - provides CMake functions for |packages| that contain Python code\\n   - see the :doc:`ament_cmake_python user documentation <../../How-To-Guides/Ament-CMake-Python-Documentation>`\\n\\n-  ``ament_cmake_test``\\n\\n   - aggregates different kinds of tests, e.g. gtest and nosetests, under a single target using `CTest <https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Testing_With_CTest>`_\\n\\nThe ``ament_cmake_core`` |package| contains a lot of the CMake infrastructure that makes it possible to cleanly pass information between |packages| using conventional interfaces.\\nThis makes the |packages| have more decoupled build interfaces with other |packages|, promoting their reuse and encouraging conventions in the build systems of different |packages|.\\nFor instance, it provides a standard way to pass include directories, libraries, definitions, and dependencies between |packages| so that consumers of this information can access this information in a conventional way.\\n\\nThe ``ament_cmake_core`` |package| also provides features of the ``ament`` build system like symbolic link installation, which allows you to symbolically link files from either the source space or the build space into the install space rather than copying them.\\nThis allows you to install once and then edit non-generated resources like Python code and configuration files without having to rerun the install step for them to take effect.\\nThis feature essentially replaces the \"devel space\" from ``catkin`` because it has most of the advantages with few of the complications or drawbacks.\\n\\nAnother feature provided by ``ament_cmake_core`` is the |package| resource indexing which is a way for |packages| to indicate that they contain a resource of some type.\\nThe design of this feature makes it much more efficient to answer simple questions like what |packages| are in this prefix (e.g. ``/usr/local``) because it only requires that you list the files in a single possible location under that prefix.\\nYou can read more about this feature in the `design docs <https://github.com/ament/ament_cmake/blob/{REPOS_FILE_BRANCH}/ament_cmake_core/doc/resource_index.md>`_ for the resource index.\\n\\nLike ``catkin``, ``ament_cmake_core`` also provides environment setup files and |package| specific environment hooks.\\nThe environment setup files, often named something like ``setup.bash``, are a place for |package| developers to define changes to the environment that are needed to utilize their |package|.\\nThe developers are able to do this using an \"environment hook\" which is basically an arbitrary bit of shell code that can set or modify environment variables, define shell functions, setup auto-completion rules, etc...\\nThis feature is how, for example, ROS 1 set the ``ROS_DISTRO`` environment variable without ``catkin`` knowing anything about the ROS distribution.\\n\\nThe ``ament_lint`` repository\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nLocated on |GitHub|_ at `ament/ament_lint <https://github.com/ament/ament_lint>`_, this repository provides several |packages| which provide linting and testing services in a convenient and consistent manner.\\nCurrently there are |packages| to support C++ style linting using ``uncrustify``, static C++ code checks using ``cppcheck``, checking for copyright in source code, Python style linting using ``pep8``, and other things.\\nThe list of helper packages will likely grow in the future.\\n\\nMeta-build tool\\n---------------\\n\\nThis is a piece of software that knows how to topologically order a group of packages, and build or test them in the correct dependency order.\\nThis software will call into the Build Tool to do the actual work of compiling, testing, and installing the package.\\n\\nIn ROS 2, the tool named `colcon <https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/>`__ is used for this.\\n'}\n",

Concepts/About-Internal-Interfaces\\n\\nInternal ROS 2 interfaces\\n=========================\\n\\n.. contents:: Table of Contents\\n   :local:\\n\\n.. include:: ../../../global_substitutions.txt\\n\\nThe internal ROS interfaces are public C |APIs| that are intended for use by developers who are creating |client libraries| or adding a new underlying middleware, but are not intended for use by typical ROS users.\\nThe ROS |client libraries| provide the user facing |APIs| that most ROS users are familiar with, and may come in a variety of programming languages.\\n\\nInternal API Architecture Overview\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nThere are two main internal interfaces:\\n\\n- the ROS middleware interface (``rmw`` |API|)\\n- the ROS client library interface (``rcl`` |API|)\\n\\nThe ``rmw`` |API| is the interface between the ROS 2 software stack and the underlying middleware implementation.\\nThe underlying middleware used for ROS 2 is either a DDS or RTPS implementation, and is responsible for discovery, publish and subscribe mechanics, request-reply mechanics for services, and serialization of message types.\\n\\nThe ``rcl`` |API| is a slightly higher level |API| which is used to implement the |client libraries| and does not touch the middleware implementation directly, but rather does so through the ROS middleware interface (``rmw`` |API|) abstraction.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../images/ros_client_library_api_stack.png\\n   :alt: ros2 software stack\\n\\nAs the diagram shows, these |APIs| are stacked such that the typical ROS user will use the |client library| |API|, e.g. ``rclcpp``, to implement their code (executable or library).\\nThe implementation of the |client libraries|, e.g. ``rclcpp``, use the ``rcl`` interface which provides access to the ROS graph and graph events.\\nThe ``rcl`` implementation in turn uses the ``rmw`` |API| to access the ROS graph.\\nThe purpose of the ``rcl`` implementation is to provide a common implementation for more complex ROS concepts and utilities that may be used by various |client libraries|, while remaining agnostic to the underlying middleware being used.\\nThe purpose of the ``rmw`` interface is to capture the absolute minimum middleware functionality needed to support ROS\\'s client libraries.\\nFinally, the implementation of the ``rmw`` |API| is provided by a middleware implementation specific |package|, e.g. ``rmw_fastrtps_cpp``, the library of which is compiled against vendor specific DDS interfaces and types.\\n\\nIn the diagram above there is also a box labeled ``ros_to_dds``, and the purpose of this box is to represent a category of possible packages which allow the user to access DDS vendor specific objects and settings using the ROS equivalents.\\nOne of the goals of this abstraction interface is to completely insulate the ROS user space code from the middleware being used, so that changing DDS vendors or even middleware technology has a minimal impact on the users code.\\nHowever, we recognize that on occasion it is useful to reach into the implementation and manually adjust settings despite the consequences that might have.\\nBy requiring the use of one of these packages in order to access the underlying DDS vendor\\'s objects, we can avoid exposing vendor specific symbols and headers in the normal interface.\\nIt also makes it easy to see what code is potentially violating the vendor portability by inspecting the package\\'s dependencies to see if one of these ``ros_to_dds`` packages are being used.\\n\\n.. _Type Specific Interfaces:\\n\\nType Specific Interfaces\\n------------------------\\n\\nAll along the way there are some parts of the |APIs| that are necessarily specific to the message types being exchanged, e.g. publishing a message or subscribing to a topic, and therefore require generated code for each message type.\\nThe following diagram layouts the path from user defined ``rosidl`` files, e.g. ``.msg`` files, to the type specific code used by the user and system to perform type specific functions:\\n\\n.. figure:: ../images/ros_idl_api_stack_static.png\\n   :alt: ros2 idl static type support stack\\n\\n   Figure: flow chart of \"static\" type support generation, from ``rosidl`` files to user facing code.\\n\\nThe right hand side of the diagram shows how the ``.msg`` files are passed directly to language specific code generators, e.g. ``rosidl_generator_cpp`` or ``rosidl_generator_py``.\\nThese generators are responsible for creating the code that the user will include (or import) and use as the in-memory representation of the messages that were defined in the ``.msg`` files.\\nFor example, consider the message ``std_msgs/String``, a user might use this file in C++ with the statement ``#include <std_msgs/msg/string.hpp>``, or they might use the statement ``from std_msgs.msg import String`` in Python.\\nThese statements work because of the files generated by these language specific (but middleware agnostic) generator packages.\\n\\nSeparately, the ``.msg`` files are used to generate type support code for each type.\\nIn this context, type support means: meta data or functions that are specific to a given type and that are used by the system to perform particular tasks for the given type.\\nThe type support for a given message might include things like a list of the names and types for each field in the message.\\nIt might also contain a reference to code that can perform particular tasks for that type, e.g. publish a message.\\n\\nStatic Type Support\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWhen the type support references code to do particular functions for a specific message type, that code sometimes needs to do middleware specific work.\\nFor example, consider the type specific publish function, when using \"vendor A\" the function will need to call some of \"vendor A\"\\'s |API|, but when using \"vendor B\" it will need to call \"vendor B\"\\'s |API|.\\nTo allow for middleware vendor specific code, the user defined ``.msg`` files may result in the generation of vendor specific code.\\nThis vendor specific code is still hidden from the user through the type support abstraction, which is similar to how the \"Private Implementation\" (or Pimpl) pattern works.\\n\\nStatic Type Support with DDS\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nFor middleware vendors based on DDS, and specifically those which generate code based on the OMG IDL files (``.idl`` files), the user defined ``rosidl`` files (``.msg`` files) are converted into equivalent OMG IDL files (``.idl`` files).\\nFrom these OMG IDL files, vendor specific code is created and then used within the type specific functions which are referenced by the type support for a given type.\\nThe above diagram shows this on the left hand side, where the ``.msg`` files are consumed by the ``rosidl_dds`` package to produce ``.idl`` files, and then those ``.idl`` files are given to language specific and DDS vendor specific type support generation packages.\\n\\nFor example, consider the Fast DDS implementation, which has a package called ``rosidl_typesupport_fastrtps_cpp``.\\nThis package is responsible for generating code to handle things like converting a C++ message object into a serialized octet buffer to be written over the network.\\nThis code, while specific to Fast DDS, is still not exposed to the user because of the abstraction in the type support code.\\n\\nDynamic Type Support\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nAnother way to implement type support is to have generic functions for things like publishing to a topic, rather than generating a version of the function for each message type.\\nIn order to accomplish this, this generic function needs some meta information about the message type being published, things like a list of field names and types in the order in which they appear in the message type.\\nThen to publish a message, you call a generic publish function and pass a message to be published along with a structure which contains the necessary meta data about the message type.\\nThis is referred to as \"dynamic\" type support, as opposed to \"static\" type support which requires generated versions of a function for each type.\\n\\n.. figure:: ../images/ros_idl_api_stack_dynamic.png\\n   :alt: ros2 idl dynamic type support stack\\n\\n   Figure: flow chart of \"dynamic\" type support generation, from ``rosidl`` files to user facing code.\\n\\nThe above diagram shows the flow from user defined ``rosidl`` files to generated user facing code.\\nIt is very similar to the diagram for static type support, and differs only in how the type support is generated which is represented by the left hand side of the diagram.\\nIn dynamic type support the ``.msg`` files are converted directly into user facing code.\\n\\nThis code is also middleware agnostic, because it only contains meta information about the messages.\\nThe function to actually do the work, e.g. publishing to a topic, is generic to the message type and will make any necessary calls to the middleware specific |APIs|.\\nNote that rather than dds vendor specific packages providing the type support code, which is the case in static type support, this method has middleware agnostic package for each language, e.g. ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_c`` and ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_cpp``.\\nThe ``introspection`` part of the package name refers to the ability to introspect any message instance with the generated meta data for the message type.\\nThis is the fundamental capability that allows for generic implementations of functions like \"publish to a topic\".\\n\\nThis approach has the advantage that all generated code is middleware agnostic, which means it can be reused for different middleware implementations, so long as they allow for dynamic type support.\\nIt also results in less generated code, which reduces compile time and code size.\\n\\nHowever, dynamic type support requires that the underlying middleware support a similar form of dynamic type support.\\nIn the case of DDS the DDS-XTypes standard allows for publishing of messages using meta information rather than generated code.\\nDDS-XTypes, or something like it, is required in the underlying middleware in order to support dynamic type support.\\nAlso, this approach to type support is normally slower than the static type support alternative.\\nThe type specific generated code in static type support can be written to be more efficient as it does not need to iterate over the message type\\'s meta data to perform things like serialization.\\n\\nThe ``rcl`` repository\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe ROS Client Library interface (``rcl`` |API|) can be used by |client libraries| (e.g. ``rclc``, ``rclcpp``, ``rclpy``, etc.) in order to avoid duplicating logic and features.\\nBy reusing the ``rcl`` |API|, client libraries can be smaller and more consistent with each other.\\nSome parts of the client library are intentionally left out of the ``rcl`` |API| because the language idiomatic method should be used to implement those parts of the system.\\nA good example of this is the execution model, which ``rcl`` does not address at all.\\nInstead the client library should provide a language idiomatic solution like ``pthreads`` in C, ``std::thread`` in C++11, and ``threading.Thread`` in Python.\\nGenerally the ``rcl`` interface provides functions that are not specific to a language pattern and are not specific to a particular message type.\\n\\nThe ``rcl`` |API| is located in the `ros2/rcl <https://github.com/ros2/rcl>`_ repository on |GitHub|_ and contains the interface as C headers.\\nThe ``rcl`` C implementation is provided by the ``rcl`` |package| in the same repository.\\nThis implementation avoids direct contact with the middleware by instead using the ``rmw`` and ``rosidl`` |APIs|.\\n\\nFor a complete definition of the ``rcl`` |API|, see `the rcl docs <http://docs.ros.org/en/{DISTRO}/p/rcl/>`_.\\n\\nThe ``rmw`` repository\\n----------------------\\n\\nThe ROS middleware interface (``rmw`` |API|) is the minimal set of primitive middleware capabilities needed to build ROS on top.\\nProviders of different middleware implementations must implement this interface in order to support the entire ROS stack on top.\\nCurrently all of the middleware implementations are for different DDS vendors.\\n\\nThe ``rmw`` |API| is located in the `ros2/rmw <https://github.com/ros2/rmw>`_ repository.\\nThe ``rmw`` |package| contains the C headers which define the interface, the implementation of which is provided by the various |packages| of rmw implementations for different DDS vendors.\\n\\nFor a definition of the ``rmw`` |API|, see `the rmw docs <http://docs.ros.org/en/{DISTRO}/p/rmw/>`_.\\n\\n\\nThe ``rosidl`` repository\\n-------------------------\\n\\nThe ``rosidl`` |API| consists of a few message related static functions and types along with a definition of what code should be generated by messages in different languages.\\nThe generated message code specified in the |API| will be language specific, but may or may not reuse generated code for other languages.\\nThe generated message code specified in the |API| contains things like the message data structure, functions for construction, destruction, etc.\\nThe |API| will also implement a way to get the type support structure for the message type, which is used when publishing or subscribing to a topic of that message type.\\n\\nThere are several repositories that play a role in the ``rosidl`` |API| and implementation.\\n\\nThe ``rosidl`` repository, located on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rosidl <https://github.com/ros2/rosidl>`_, defines the message IDL syntax, i.e. syntax of ``.msg`` files, ``.srv`` files, etc., and contains |packages| for parsing the files, for providing CMake infrastructure to generate code from the messages, for generating implementation agnostic code (headers and source files), and for establishing the default set of generators.\\nThe repository contains these |packages|:\\n\\n-  ``rosidl_cmake``: provides CMake functions and modules for generating code from ``rosidl`` files, e.g. ``.msg`` files, ``.srv`` files, etc.\\n-  ``rosidl_default_generators``: defines the list of default generators which ensures that they are installed as dependencies, but other injected generators can also be used.\\n-  ``rosidl_generator_c``: provides tools to generate C header files (``.h``) for ``rosidl`` files.\\n-  ``rosidl_generator_cpp``: provides tools to generate C++ header files (``.hpp``) for ``rosidl`` files.\\n-  ``rosidl_generator_py``: provides tools to generate Python modules for ``rosidl`` files.\\n-  ``rosidl_parser``: provides Python |API| for parsing ``rosidl`` files.\\n\\nGenerators for other languages, e.g. ``rosidl_generator_java``, are hosted externally (in different repositories) but would use the same mechanism that the above generators use to \"register\" themselves as a ``rosidl`` generator.\\n\\nIn addition to the aforementioned |packages| for parsing and generating headers for the ``rosidl`` files, the ``rosidl`` repository also contains |packages| concerned with \"type support\" for the message types defined in the files.\\nType support refers to the ability to interpret and manipulate the information represented by ROS message instances of particular types (publishing the messages, for example).\\nType support can either be provided by code that is generated at compile time or it can be done programmatically based on the contents of the ``rosidl`` file, e.g. the ``.msg`` or ``.srv`` file, and the data received, by introspecting the data.\\nIn the case of the latter, where type support is done through runtime interpretation of the messages, the message code generated by ROS 2 can be agnostic to the rmw implementation.\\nThe packages that provide this type support through introspection of the data are:\\n\\n-  ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_c``: provides tools for generating C code for supporting ``rosidl`` message data types.\\n-  ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_cpp``: provides tools for generating C++ code for supporting ``rosidl`` message data types.\\n\\nIn the case where type support is to be generated at compile time instead of being generated programmatically, a package specific to the rmw implementation will need to be used.\\nThis is because typically a particular rmw implementation will require data to be stored and manipulated in a manner that is specific to the DDS vendor in order for the DDS implementation to make use of it.\\nSee the :ref:`Type Specific Interfaces` section above for more details.\\n\\nFor more information on what exactly is in the ``rosidl`` |API| (static and generated) see this page:\\n\\nThe ``rcutils`` repository\\n--------------------------\\n\\nROS 2 C Utilities (``rcutils``) is a C |API| composed of macros, functions, and data structures used throughout the ROS 2 codebase.\\nThese are mainly used for error handling, commandline argument parsing, and logging which are not specific to the client or middleware layers and can be shared by both.\\n\\nThe ``rcutils`` |API| and implementation are located in the `ros2/rcutils <https://github.com/ros2/rcutils>`_ repository on |GitHub|_ which contains the interface as C headers.\\n\\nFor a complete definition of the ``rcutils`` |API|, see `the rcutils docs <https://docs.ros.org/en/{DISTRO}/p/rcutils/>`_.\\n'}\n",

|APIs|.\\n\\nCommon Packages for DDS Middleware Packages\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nAll of the current ROS middleware implementations are based on full or partial DDS implementations.\\nFor example, there is a middleware implementation that uses RTI\\'s Connext DDS and an implementation which uses eProsima\\'s Fast DDS.\\nBecause of this, there are some shared |packages| amongst most DDS based middleware implementations.\\n\\nIn the `ros2/rosidl_dds <https://github.com/ros2/rosidl_dds>`_ repository on |GitHub|_, there is the following |package|:\\n\\n-  ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl``: provides tools to generate DDS ``.idl`` files from ``rosidl`` files, e.g. ``.msg`` files, ``.srv`` files, etc.\\n\\nThe ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl`` |package| generates a DDS ``.idl`` file for each ``rosidl`` file, e.g. ``.msg`` file, defined by |packages| containing messages.\\nCurrently DDS based ROS middleware implementations make use of this generator\\'s output ``.idl`` files to generate pre-compiled type support that is vendor specific.\\n\\nStructure of ROS Middleware Implementations\\n-------------------------------------------\\n\\nA ROS middleware implementation is typically made up of a few |packages| in a single repository:\\n\\n- ``<implementation_name>_cmake_module``: contains CMake Module for discovering and exposing required dependencies\\n- ``rmw_<implementation_name>_<language>``: contains the implementation of the ``rmw`` |API| in a particular language, typically C++\\n- ``rosidl_typesupport_<implementation_name>_<language>``: contains tools to generate static type support code for ``rosidl`` files, tailored to the implementation in a particular language, typically C or C++\\n\\nThe ``<implementation_name>_cmake_module`` |package| contains any CMake Modules and functions needed to find the supporting dependencies for the middleware implementation.\\nFor example, ``rti_connext_dds_cmake_module`` provides wrapper logic around the CMake Module shipped with RTI Connext DDS to make sure that all packages that depend on it will select the same installation of RTI Connext DDS.\\nSimilarly, ``fastrtps_cmake_module`` includes a CMake Module to find eProsima\\'s Fast DDS and ``gurumdds_cmake_module`` includes a CMake Module to find GurumNetworks GurumDDS.\\nNot all implementations will have a package like this: for example, Eclipe\\'s Cyclone DDS already provides a CMake Module which is used directly by its RMW implementation without the need of additional wrappers.\\n\\nThe ``rmw_<implementation_name>_<language>`` |package| implements the ``rmw`` C |API| in a particular language.\\nThe implementation itself can be C++, it just must expose the header\\'s symbols as ``extern \"C\"`` so that C applications can link against it.\\n\\nThe ``rosidl_typesupport_<implementation_name>_<language>`` |package| provides a generator which generates DDS code in a particular language.\\nThis is done using the ``.idl`` files generated by the ``rosidl_generator_dds_idl`` |package| and the DDS IDL code generator provided by the DDS vendor.\\nIt also generates code for converting ROS message structures to and from DDS message structures.\\nThis generator is also responsible for creating a shared library for the message package it is being used in, which is specific to the messages in the message package and to the DDS vendor being used.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, the ``rosidl_typesupport_introspection_<language>`` may be used instead of a vendor specific type support package if an rmw implementation supports runtime interpretation of messages.\\nThis ability to programmatically send and receive types over topics without generating code beforehand is achieved by supporting the `DDS X-Types Dynamic Data standard <http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS-XTypes>`_.\\nAs such, rmw implementations may provide support for the X-Types standard, and/or provide a package for type support generated at compile time specific to their DDS implementation.\\n\\nAs an example of an rmw implementation repository, the ``Eclipse Cyclone DDS`` ROS middleware implementation is on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rmw_cyclonedds <https://github.com/ros2/rmw_cyclonedds>`_.\\n\\nThe rmw implementation for ``Fast DDS`` is on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rmw_fastrtps_cpp <https://github.com/ros2/rmw_fastrtps_cpp>`_.\\n\\nThe rmw implementation for ``Connext DDS`` is on |GitHub|_ at `ros2/rmw_connextdds <https://github.com/ros2/rmw_connextdds>`_.\\n\\nThe rmw implementation for ``GurumDDS`` is on |GitHub|_ at `ros/rmw_gurumdds <https://github.com/ros2/rmw_gurumdds>`_.\\n'}\n",

Assisted Teleop\\n==================\\n\\n**Task description** \\n\\nIn mobile robot and autonomous vehicle navigation, there are situations where a human driver is required to intervene to get the vehicle out of a sticky situation. This can be both as a backup in case of autonomy failure as well as the primary function of the robot (e.g. telepresence robots). \\n\\nThis project's aim is to create an assisted teleop feature in Nav2 by means of a new behavior tree configuration file (the file that defines the flow of information for the navigation task) and potentially new plugins. This feature should make sure to use the local costmap and/or sensor data in order to avoid obstacles and take position and/or velocity commands to attempt to follow.\\n\\nAn example application of this is a telepresence robot, where a human driver is driving the robot through a space to visit in an office building or hospital. Another example would be an autonomous delivery robot stuck requiring a human driver to navigate it back into an open space for the robot to continue its task.\\n\\nThis will be an excellent chance to make a substantial new feature in the Nav2 system to be used by hundreds of robots in the future.

Navigation Dynamic Obstacle Integration\\n==========================================\\n\\n**Task description** \\n\\nThe Navigation Stack has long provided robust navigation in a wide range of environments. Controllers have been developed to operate effectively in the presence of dynamic obstacles without explicitly modeling the characteristics of dynamic obstacles. However, as the field has progressed and we see more and more robots using ROS deployed in human-filled spaces, more consideration must be taken with respect to dynamic obstacles such as people, carts, animals, and vehicles.\\n\\nYour task will be to create integrations with existing machine learning tools that create dynamic obstacle information (ComplexYolo, Yolo3D, etc) and tie them into the navigation stack for use. It is not in the scope for you to retrain or otherwise become an expert in 3D machine learning, but some basic knowledge will be helpful. We already have a starting point in the project links below that needs to be driven to completion. This includes completing the on-going work to integrate yolact edge into this work to replace detectron2 and benchmark these capabilities on GPUs to verify sufficient run-time performance, as well as other tangental feature development.\\n\\nThis task will involve identifying a few techniques that produce position and velocity information about dynamic obstacles that can run on a mobile robot (using high-power Intel CPU, Nvidia Jetson SoC, external GPUs, etc) and get them running with ROS and Navigation. Next, you will help create a new costmap layer to use this information to mark the dynamic obstacle in the costmap to ensure a robot does not collide with a future trajectory of an obstacle.\\n\\nIf time permits, you may also work to also integrate this dynamic information into a path planner and/or controller to help in direct motion consideration.

Port Grid Maps to ROS 2 and Environmental Model\\n==================================================\\n\\n**Task description** \\nGrid Maps was created by ETH Zurich and later transferred to ANYbotics. It is a universal grid map library for mobile robotic mapping that can be used as the basis of environmental models and various forms of grid maps available in ROS 1. This library is one of the top downloaded ROS packages. Your task will be to work with the community and the mentor to port grid_maps metapackage from ROS 1 to ROS 2 and help develop the next generation environment model in ROS 2 to replace costmap_2d.\\n\\nThis will involve porting code from ROS 1 to ROS 2, analyzing uses of the environmental model to define an abstract interface to allow replacement of costmap_2d with grid_map, and building up the basic grid-operations for costmaps. It is not expected to complete the full new model with sensor processing over the course of the summer. If completed early, you may be able to help design a gradient model to complement your implemented costmap model using grid_maps. This will allow robots to select a gradient or a costmap model on startup.\\n\\n**Project difficulty: High**\\n\\n**Project community mentor: Steve Macenski** `@SteveMacenski <https://github.com/SteveMacenski>`_\\n\\n**Mentor contact details: [See link above, link in GitHub profile description]**\\n\\n**Project output requirements**\\n\\n- Grid Maps ported to ROS 2 and merged into the main ROS 2 branch\\n- Defined plugin interfaces to replace costmap 2D with grid maps\\n- Implementing low-level operations on top of grid_maps to replace the base costmap_2d object.\\n- You will not be expected to reimplement the full sensor processing mechanics of costmap_2d.\\n\\n**Skills required**\\n\\n- C++ and Git\\n- ROS recommended ROS 2, but you can pick it up before starting\\n- Coordinate transformations and basic geometry\\n- Recommended: Gazebo simulation and Navigation experience\\n\\n**List of relevant open source software repositories and refs** \\n\\n- `ROS <https://www.ros.org/>`_\\n- `Gazebo Simulator <http://gazebosim.org/>`_\\n- `Original github issue 1 <https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/issues/1278>`_\\n- `Original github issue 2 <https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/issues/1517>`_\\n- `Navigation2 <https://docs.nav2.org/>`_\\n\\n**Licensing**\\n- All contributions will be under the Apache 2.0 license.\\n- No other CLA's are required.\\n\\n\"}\n",

Over the last 10 years, essentially no updates to AMCL has been made. This is due to the code base for this implementation of an Adaptive Monte Carlo Localizer is written in embedded C, not well structured, and very sensitive to changes. A-MCL implementations have been a hallmark of localization for over a decade but this particular implementation should be deprecated. \\n\\nYour target involves designing and creating a new localization engine for the Nav2 stack. The requirements of this are:\\n- Support 2D laser scanners\\n- Support 3D laser scanners, where 2D case could potentially be a simplified case\\n- Accurately track the localization of a robot in a given occupancy grid\\n\\nThe reason that specific method is left open-ended is to allow for creativity, novelty, or reimplementation of a what you feel is best. We have, however, analyzed other MCL variants as being good options. This may include reimplementing an A-MCL that is designed to be modified with modular components and support sampling from a 3D lidar. Another option is a NDT-MCL using NDT 2D/3D scan matching. Other options may be proposed and discussed with mentors during the application phase. The task involves 3D as well since there is no standard 3D localizer in ROS 2 yet and more and more robust 3D SLAM libraries have emerged over the last 2 years. \\n\\nAn optional but recommended feature of this work would be to also accept the inputs from multiple laser scanners.

Navigation Safety Node\\n=========================\\n\\n**Task description** \\n\\nThe aim of this project is to create a safety watchdog node to ensure the robot is acting properly and not about to collide with an obstacle. Typical safety-rated lidars will contain \"safety zones\" whereas if any sensor points are located in a box around the lidar, then the lidar will send a signal to the robot to stop due to a potential collision. However, less and less people are using safety-rated lidars as consumer available lidars are dropping in cost and 3D lidars are seeing more use in mobile robotics.\\n\\nYour project will be to re-create this logic at the Navigation level. While this wouldn\\'t be \"safety certified\", this is a significant functional improvement on safety that could potentially safe real people from real injuries in the real-world. The project will be to create a node that sits below the navigation stack but above the robot controller to do the following:\\n\\n- Take in the current command velocity from navigation and the most recent laser or RGBD scan\\n- Projecting the velocity forward in time ``N`` seconds, check if that velocity will result in a collision with any sensor measurements\\n- If not, allow the velocity command through to the base\\n- If it does collide, scale back the velocity such that the robot will always be at minimum ``N`` seconds from a collision\\n- Optionally if a flag is set, if ``M`` or more points are in defined bounding boxes around the robot, send only ``0`` commands to enact an emergency stop. \\n\\nThis will be an excellent chance to make mobile robots and Nav2 users significantly safer and run at higher speeds in their production or research environments.

If you're interested in working on this, you will become one of the few that truly understand the inner workings of it and be a very marketable skill. We do not expect anyone applying for this project to have that knowledge beforehand and we will help you learn the necessary items.\\n\\nROS 2 architecturally was changed before Foxy in order to ensure that any single process containing multiple ROS 2 node objects will share the same DDS participant on the network. This is important due to the overhead that each additional DDS participant has on the system.\\n\\nIn order for nav2 to leverage this the best, we need to adjust our usage of ROS 2 nodes and executors to further minimize the number of node objects in existence. In the early days of ROS 2 when Nav2 was being built, we were required to have many nodes in a single server in order to handle action requests and other callbacks. Now, we can make use of multi-threaded spinners, callback groups, and individual executors for specific tasks.\\n\\nThis project will involve identifying all of the Node objects in the stack (control+F makes this easy) and work with mentors to ensure by the end of the summer each server contains only a single node. Additionally, the behavior tree plugins should be updated to leverage callback groups to ensure that any single BT node spinning to check if any new messages are on its callback will **only** trigger its own callback by the same mechanisms.\\n\\nMore details about this project can be supplied if interested, but the tickets linked below also provide more context. Trust me to say this is a very achievable goal over the course of the summer and will also let you look under the hood of both Nav2 and rclcpp, giving you valuable insight future in your career (and put you in the top 10% of ROS 2 developers that know it to this degree).\\n\\n**Project difficulty: Medium**\\n\\n**Project community mentor: Steve Macenski** `@SteveMacenski <https://github.com/SteveMacenski>`_\\n\\n**Mentor contact details: [See link above, link in GitHub profile description]**\\n\\n**Project output requirements**\\n- Remove excess ROS 2 nodes from stack and replace with executors and multi-threaded executors\\n- Replace Behavior Tree node spinners with local executors to ensure deterministic execution & processing only callback groups of the current BT node\\n- If time allots, create a single ``main()`` function Nav2 executable composing all Nav2 processes and benchmarking improvements in performance\\n\\n**Skills required**\\n\\n- C++, ROS\\n\\n**List of relevant open source software repositories and refs** \\n\\n- `ROS <https://www.ros.org/>`_\\n- `Gazebo Simulator <http://gazebosim.org/>`_\\n- `Github ticket <https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/issues/2251>`_\\n- `Github ticket2 <https://github.com/ros-navigation/navigation2/issues/816>`_\\n- `Navigation2 <https://docs.nav2.org/>`_\\n- `Some related works <https://alyssapierson.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/pierson2018.pdf>`_\\n\\n**Licensing**\\n- All contributions will be under the Apache 2.0 license.\\n- No other CLA's are required.\\n\"}\n",

There are two ways that you can start a pull request:\\n1. If you are not familiar with GitHub or how to create a pull request, [here is a guide you can follow](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) on how GitHub works.\\n2. If you are familiar with the terminal or would like to learn to use it, [here is a great tutorial](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) on how to send a pull request using the terminal.\\n\\n- [ ] 🏁 **Done** Ask in comments for a review :)\\n\\n### Is someone else already working on this?\\n\\n🔗- We encourage contributors to link to the original issue in their pull request so all users can easily see if someone's already started on it.\\n\\n👥- **If someone seems stuck, offer them some help!**\\n\\n### 🤔❓ Questions?\\n\\nDon’t hesitate to ask questions or to get help if you feel like you are getting stuck. For example leave a comment below!\\nFurthermore, you find helpful resources here:\\n* [MoveIt FAQ](https://moveit.ros.org/documentation/faqs/)\\n* [MoveIt Tutorials](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/tutorials/tutorials.html)\\n* [MoveIt contribution guide](https://moveit.picknik.ai/main/doc/how_to_contribute/how_to_contribute.html)\\n* [ROS Tutorials](https://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)\\n* [ROS Answers](https://answers.ros.org/questions/)\\n\\n**Good luck with your first issue!**\\n\"}\n",

The documentation\\ncontained in this repository can be view at\\n[https://gazebosim.org/docs](https://gazebosim.org/docs).\\n\\nEach [Gazebo library](https://gazebosim.org/libs) maintains\\ndocumentation and tutorials that are scoped to the features and\\ncapabilities of the library itself.

There are no binaries for Windows at this moment. The `gz-sim`\\npackage is still not available for Windows, the installation should be done from\\nsource code.\\n\\n## Acropolis Libraries\\n\\nThe Acropolis collection is composed by many different Gazebo libraries. The\\ncollection assures that all libraries all compatible and can be used together.\\n\\n| Library name       | Version       |\\n| ------------------ |:-------------:|\\n|   gz-cmake         |       2.x     |\\n|   gz-common        |       3.x     |\\n|   gz-fuel-tools    |       3.x     |\\n|   gz-sim           |       1.x     |\\n|   gz-gui           |       1.x     |\\n|   gz-launch        |       0.x     |\\n|   gz-math          |       6.x     |\\n|   gz-msgs          |       3.x     |\\n|   gz-physics       |       1.x     |\\n|   gz-plugin        |       1.x     |\\n|   gz-rendering     |       1.x     |\\n|   gz-sensors       |       1.x     |\\n|   gz-tools         |       0.x     |\\n|   gz-transport     |       6.x     |\\n|   sdformat         |       8.x     |\\n\\n# Option 1: Installation on Ubuntu Bionic\\n\\nAll of the Acropolis binaries are hosted in the osrfoundation repository. To install\\nall of them, the metapackage `gazebo-acropolis` can be installed:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo sh -c \\'echo \"deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list\\'\\nwget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -\\nsudo apt-get update\\nsudo apt-get install gazebo-acropolis\\n```\\n\\nAll libraries should be ready to use and  the `gz-sim` app ready to be executed.\\n\\n# Option 2: Install on MacOS Mojave (10.14)\\n\\nAll the Acropolis binaries are available in Mojave using the [homebrew package manager](https://brew.sh/).\\nThe homebrew tool can easily be installed using:\\n\\n```bash\\n/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)\"\\n```\\n\\nAfter installing the homebrew package manager, Gazebo Acropolis can be installed running:\\n\\n```bash\\nbrew tap osrf/simulation\\nbrew install gazebo-acropolis\\n```\\n\\nAll libraries should be ready to use and  the `gz-sim` app ready to be executed.\\n\\n# Option 3: Source Installation (any platform)\\n\\nThe use of some additional tools is recommended to help with the source compilation, although other ways of correctly getting and building the sources are also possible.\\n\\nColcon supports python 3.5 (or higher) which is not the default option in some\\nplatforms (like Ubuntu Bionic). The python [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) could be a useful solution in cases where the default option can not be easily changed.\\n\\n## Installing vcstool and colcon\\n\\nFor getting the sources of all libraries the easiest way is to use\\n[vcstool](https://github.com/dirk-thomas/vcstool). The tool is available from pip\\nin all platforms:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install vcstool\\n```\\n\\nTo compile all the different libraries and gz-sim in the right order\\nit is recommended to use [colcon](https://colcon.readthedocs.io/en/released/).\\nThe colcon tool is available in all platforms using pip:\\n\\n```bash\\npip install -U colcon-common-extensions\\n```\\n\\n### Use .deb packages in Ubuntu to install vcstool and colcon\\n\\nAn alternative method is to use the .deb packages available on Debian or Ubuntu:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo sh -c \\'echo \"deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list\\'\\n\\nsudo apt-get install curl # if curl isn\\'t already installed\\ncurl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -\\n\\nsudo apt-get update\\nsudo apt-get install python3-vcstool python3-colcon-common-extensions\\n```\\n\\n## Getting the sources\\n\\nThe instructions below use some UNIX commands to manage directories but the\\nobvious alternatives on Windows should provide the same result.\\n\\nThe first step would be to create a developer workspace in which `vcstool` and\\n`colcon` can work.\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir -p ~/workspace/src\\ncd ~/workspace/src\\n```\\n\\nAll the sources of gazebo-acropolis are declared in a yaml file. Download\\nit to the workspace.\\n\\n```bash\\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gazebo-tooling/gazebodistro/master/collection-acropolis.yaml\\n```\\n\\nUse `vcstool` to automatically retrieve all the Gazebo libraries sources from\\ntheir repositories:\\n\\n```bash\\nvcs import < collection-acropolis.yaml\\n```\\n\\nThe src subdirectory should contain all the sources ready to be built.\\n\\n## Install dependencies\\n\\nBefore compiling it is necessary to install all the dependencies of the diferent\\npackages that compose the Acropolis collection. Every platform has a different\\nmethod to install software dependencies.\\n\\nTo add packages.osrfoundation.org to your apt sources list:\\n```bash\\nsudo sh -c \\'echo \"deb http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo/ubuntu-stable `lsb_release -cs` main\" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gazebo-stable.list\\'\\nwget http://packages.osrfoundation.org/gazebo.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -\\nsudo apt-get update\\n```\\n\\nAs reference the command below will\\ninstall all dependencies in Ubuntu Bionic:\\n```bash\\nsudo apt-get install cmake freeglut3-dev libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libdart6-collision-ode-dev libdart6-dev libdart6-utils-urdf-dev libfreeimage-dev libgflags-dev libglew-dev libgts-dev libogre-1.9-dev libogre-2.1-dev libprotobuf-dev libprotobuf-dev libprotoc-dev libqt5core5a libswscale-dev libtinyxml2-dev libtinyxml-dev pkg-config protobuf-compiler qml-module-qt-labs-folderlistmodel qml-module-qt-labs-settings qml-module-qtquick2 qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-controls2 qml-module-qtquick-dialogs qml-module-qtquick-layouts qtbase5-dev qtdeclarative5-dev qtquickcontrols2-5-dev ruby ruby-ronn uuid-dev libgtest-dev curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libsqlite3-dev\\n```\\n\\n## Building the Gazebo Libraries\\n\\nThe Gazebo Libraries require the following compilers on each platform:\\n\\n* Ubuntu Bionic: gcc 8\\n* MacOS Mojave: Xcode 10\\n* Windows: Visual Studio 2017\\n\\n### Installing gcc version 8 on Ubuntu Bionic\\n\\nTo install `gcc` version 8 on Ubuntu Bionic:\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo apt-get install g++-8\\n```\\n\\nSet `gcc-8` and `g++-8` to be the default compilers.\\n\\n```bash\\nsudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 800 --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8 --slave /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-8\\n```\\n\\nAt this point `gcc`  and `g++` should both report version 8. Test this with\\nthe following commands.\\n\\n```bash\\ngcc -v\\ng++ -v\\n```\\n\\n### Building the colcon workspace\\n\\nOnce the compiler and all the sources are in place it is time to compile them.\\nStart the procedure by changing into the workspace and listing the packages\\nrecognized by `colcon`:\\n\\n```bash\\ncd ~/workspace/\\ncolcon list -g\\n```\\n\\n`colcon` should list the Gazebo libraries with their\\ninterdependencies. If that is the case, then you are ready\\nto build the whole set of libraries:\\n\\n```bash\\ncolcon build\\n```\\n\\nIf there are no errors, all the binaries should be ready to use.\\n\\n## Using the workspace\\n\\nThe workspace binaries are ready but every time that `gz-sim` needs to be\\nexecuted or third party code is going to be developed using the Gazebo\\nlibraries, one command is needed:\\n\\n```bash\\n. ~/workspace/install/local_setup.bash\\n(or call ~/workspace/install/local_setup.bat on Windows)\\n```\\n\\nAfter running the command all paths for running apps or developing code\\nwill be set in the current shell.\\n'}\n",

'https://github.com/gazebosim/docs/blob/master/architecture.md', 'content': \"# Gazebo Sim Architecture\\n\\n[Gazebo Sim](https://gazebosim.org/libs/gazebo) is an application entry-point of Gazebo, generally encompassing the use of all other Gazebo libraries.\\nAs an executable, it runs a simulation by launching two processes: the backend server process and frontend client process.\\n\\nThe core functionality of Gazebo Sim is the client-server communication and the various plugins it loads to facilitate the simulation.\\nPlugins are libraries that are loaded at runtime.\\nThey allow Gazebo Sim to utilize other Gazebo libraries.\\nThere are many plugin types in the Gazebo framework.\\nFor example, there are plugins that introduce new physics engines or rendering engines.\\nHowever, for the purpose of this document, any mention of plugins is referring only to Gazebo Sim server and GUI plugins.\\n\\nBecause they’re loaded at runtime, Gazebo does not need to be recompiled to add or remove plugins.\\nGazebo Sim ships with many plugins by default ([Server plugins](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.5/namespaceignition_1_1gazebo_1_1systems.html), [Gazebo GUI plugins](https://gazebosim.org/api/gui/4.2/namespaceignition_1_1gui_1_1plugins.html), [Gazebo Sim GUI plugins]( https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.5/namespaceignition_1_1gazebo.html), and more), all of which are optional and can be removed by the user.\\nUsers can also add more plugins and even write their own plugins that will be compiled into library files.  \\n\\nGazebo libraries are modular.\\nPlugins let Gazebo Sim utilize other libraries.\\nFor example, [Gazebo Physics](https://gazebosim.org/libs/physics) and Gazebo Sim are independent of one another, so Gazebo Sim has a physics plugin that uses Gazebo Physics as a library and incorporates Gazebo specifics, allowing Physics to be a system running in the simulation loop.\\n\\nThe Gazebo Physics library is only used in the physics plugin, not in other plugins nor in the core of Gazebo Sim.\\nSome libraries are only used by one plugin, or one in each process (frontend and backend).\\nHowever, some foundational libraries are used by all plugins, like [Gazebo Common](https://gazebosim.org/libs/common) which provides common functionality like logging, manipulating strings, file system interaction, etc., to all plugins.\\nOther such libraries include [Gazebo Plugin](https://gazebosim.org/libs/plugin), [Gazebo Math](https://gazebosim.org/libs/math), [SDFormat](https://gazebosim.org/libs/sdformat), and more.\\n\\nThere are certain plugins in both the frontend and backend processes that are loaded by default in every version of Gazebo.\\nMany other plugins are optional.\\nOne common optional plugin is the sensors plugin.\\nBoth optional and default plugins can be removed or added at any time; Gazebo Sim will continue to run with limited functionality.\\nThese demos on [Server Configuration](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.3/server_config.html) and [GUI Configuration](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.3/gui_config.html) showcase that functionality.\\n\\nThe simulation process is depicted in the diagram below, and further explained in the Backend and Frontend process sections that follow.\\n\\n![Gazebo Sim architecture diagram](images/GazeboSimArchitecture.svg)\\n\\n## Backend server process\\n\\nGazebo Sim is responsible for loading plugins in the backend, referred to as systems.\\nThe server runs an entity-component system architecture (see [Gazebo Sim terminology](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.2/terminology.html)).\\nThe backend will usually have multiple systems responsible for everything in the simulation – computing physics, recording logs, receiving user commands, etc.\\n\\nSystems act on entities and components of those entities.\\nAn entity is anything in the simulation scene (a model, link, light, actor, etc.), and components are their characteristics (pose, name, geometry, etc.).\\nServer plugins have access to all entities and what components they have, and make modifications to those components.\\nFor example, a user could write a system that applies force to an entity by setting a component on that entity, and the physics system would pick that up and react by applying the force to make the entity actually move.\\nThe modification of entities and components is how server plugins communicate with each other.\\n\\nThe entity component system is self-contained in Gazebo Sim, and systems act on entities and their components.\\nSince other Gazebo Libraries don't have direct knowledge/access to entities and components, other Gazebo Libraries should be used in systems so that the server plugin can share entities (and their components) with these other Libraries.\\nFor example, the physics system shares entities and components with the Gazebo Physics library in order to achieve physics effects on entities and components.\\n\\nThere is a loop running in the backend that runs the systems, where some systems are proposing changes to entities and their components, and other systems are handling and applying those changes.\\nThis is called the “simulation loop”.\\nThe Entity Component Manager (ECM) in the backend provides the functionality for the actual querying and updating of the entities and components.\\n\\n[Physics](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.5/classignition_1_1gazebo_1_1systems_1_1Physics.html), [User Commands](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.5/classignition_1_1gazebo_1_1systems_1_1UserCommands.html), and [Scene Broadcaster](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.5/classignition_1_1gazebo_1_1systems_1_1SceneBroadcaster.html) are all systems launched by default in the backend.\\nAs mentioned earlier, however, even default systems can be added to or removed from the simulation loop (the [Server Configuration](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.3/server_config.html) tutorial describes how to customize default systems).\\nFor any other functionality, like sensor data processing for example, an additional system would have to be loaded.\\nFor example, if you need to generate sensor data that utilizes rendering sensors, you would need to load the [sensors system](https://gazebosim.org/api/gazebo/4.5/classignition_1_1gazebo_1_1systems_1_1Sensors.html).\\nThe visualization of that data, however, is left up to the client side plugins.\\n\\n## Communication process\\n\\nAny information that crosses the process boundary (whether back-to-front with scene broadcaster or front-to-back with user commands) has to go through [Gazebo Transport](https://gazebosim.org/libs/transport), the communication library.\\nSynchronization between processes is performed by scene broadcaster, a server-side Gazebo Sim plugin that uses the Gazebo Transport and [Gazebo Messages](https://gazebosim.org/libs/msgs) libraries to send messages from the server to the client.\\nThe messages themselves are provided by Gazebo Messages, while the framework for creating the publishers and subscribers that exchange messages is from Gazebo Transport.\\n\\nThe scene broadcaster system is responsible for getting the state of the world (all of the entities and their component values) from the ever-changing simulation loop running in the back end, packaging that information into a very compact message, and periodically sending it to the frontend process.\\nOmitting the scene broadcaster, while possible, would mean not being able to visualize data on the frontend, which can be useful for saving computational power.\\n\\nIn addition to state messages sent from the scene broadcaster to the client, the client can also make requests to the server using the user commands system (another backend plugin).\\nIt also utilizes the Gazebo Transport and Gazebo Messages libraries.\\nThe user commands system has services that can be requested by the frontend GUI to insert, delete, move (etc.) models, lights, and other entities, and will send responses back to the GUI acknowledging the receipt and execution of those requests.\\n\\nSeveral non-default plugins are able to send or receive messages to other processes outside of the server-client process.\\nFor example, the server-side sensors plugin publishes messages outside of the server-client process, and the server-side diff-drive plugin receives info from processes other than the client.\\nOne such process these plugins may communicate with, for example, is [ROS](https://www.ros.org/).\\n\\n## Frontend client process\\n\\nThe client-side process, essentially the GUI, also comprises multiple plugins, some loaded by default, others that can be added, and all optional.\\nAll of the frontend plugins use the [Gazebo GUI](https://gazebosim.org/libs/gui) library.\\nThe client itself also relies on Gazebo GUI.\\nThere are visualization plugins that create the windows of the GUI, add buttons and other interactive features, and a 3D scene plugin that utilizes [Gazebo Rendering](https://gazebosim.org/libs/rendering) that creates the scene the user sees.\\n\\nFrontend plugins typically communicate among themselves using [events](https://gazebosim.org/api/gui/4.2/namespaceignition_1_1gui_1_1events.html).\\nEvents are similar to messages, but they're processed synchronously.\\nFor example, the `Render` event is emitted by a 3D scene from it's rendering thread right before the scene is rendered; this gives other plugins the chance to execute code right at that thread at that moment, which is valuable to edit the 3D scene.\\nOther such events are emitted when the user right-clicks or hovers the scene for example.\\n\\nFrontend plugins all have access to the entity and component information from the compressed message provided by the scene broadcaster system from the backend.\\nThe Entity Component Manager on the client side performs the actual message unpacking and distributes the entity and component information to the relevant plugins.\\nThis is how visualizations know how to update in accordance with backend computations.\\nOn the client side, the plugins are only reacting to the entity and component information, not interacting with it.\\n\\nAs mentioned in the previous section, the GUI can send commands back to the server using the server’s user commands system.\\nThis would be the case, for example, if a user wanted to insert a new model through the GUI interface.\\nUser commands receives requests from the GUI and processes them, and adds those results to entities and components in the simulation loop.\\n\"}\n",
