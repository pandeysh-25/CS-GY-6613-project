achieved using ament index also called resource index ament index explained detail design intention see principle ament index contained folder within install share folder package contains shallow subfolders named different type resource within subfolder package providing said resource referenced name marker file file may contain whatever content necessary obtain resource e g relative path installation directory resource may also simply empty give example consider providing display plugins rviz providing rviz plugins project named rviz display read pluginlib provide plugin description xml file installed used pluginlib load plugins achieve plugin description xml registered resource resource index via pluginlib export plugin description file rviz common plugins description xml running colcon build installs file rviz display subfolder rviz common pluginlib plugin resource index pluginlib factory within rviz common know gather information folder named rviz common pluginlib plugin package export plugins marker file pluginlib factory contains install folder relative path plugins description xml file name library marker file name information pluginlib load library know

provides function register rviz ogre medium export directory register directory ogre medium resource ament index short installs file named project call function subfolder called rviz ogre medium export file contains install folder relative path directory listed macro startup time rviz search folder called rviz ogre medium export load resource folder provided search done using ament index cpp ament index py python package following section explore add resource ament index provide best practice querying ament index necessary possible query ament index resource via cmake three function ament index resource obtain prefix path resource exists following parameter var output parameter fill variable false resource exist prefix path resource otherwise resource type type resource e g rviz common pluginlib plugin resource name name resource usually amount name package added resource type resource type e g rviz default plugins ament index get resource obtain content specific resource e content marker file ament index var output parameter filled content resource marker file exists resource type type resource e g rviz common pluginlib plugin resource name name resource usually amount name

resource type resource type type resource e g rviz common pluginlib plugin prefix path prefix path search usually default ament index get prefix path enough adding ament index defining resource requires two bit information name resource must unique layout marker file anything could also empty true instance package resource marking ros package rviz mesh resource corresponding choice rviz ogre medium export name resource install path relative path folder containing resource already enable write logic using corresponding resource package allow user easily register resource package furthermore provide macro function pluginlib function rviz ogre medium export function register resource use ament function ament index register resource create install marker file resource index example corresponding call rviz ogre medium export following ament index register resource rviz ogre medium export content ogre medium resource file installs file named like project name folder rviz ogre medium export resource index content given variable ogre medium resource file macro number parameter useful first unnamed parameter name resource amount name folder resource index content content marker file string could list relative path etc content used together content file content file path file use create marker file file plain file template file expanded configure file content file used

use default cmake binary dir ament cmake index skip install skip installing marker file since one marker file exists per package usually problem cmake function macro get called twice project however

callback non callback function ros system found mainly edge system user sensor input etc sometimes callback hidden presence may obvious user developer api case especially kind synchronous call service action rclpy example synchronous call client call request service add future done callback need executed execution function call callback directly visible user controlling execution order control execution callback group one consider following guideline interaction individual callback register reentrant callback group executed parallel example case could action service server need able process several action call parallel register mutually exclusive callback group never executed parallel example case could timer callback run control loop publishes control command interaction different

whether individual callback able overlap register different mutually exclusive callback group overlap individual callback register reentrant callback group overlap individual callback example case running different callback parallel node synchronous service client timer calling service see detailed example avoiding deadlock setting callback group node incorrectly lead deadlock unwanted behavior especially one desire use synchronous call service action indeed even api documentation ros mention synchronous call action service done callback lead deadlock using asynchronous call indeed safer regard synchronous call also made work hand synchronous call also advantage making code simpler easier understand hence section provides guideline set node callback group correctly order avoid deadlock first thing note every node default callback group mutually exclusive callback group user specify callback group creating timer subscription client etc callback created later entity use node default callback group furthermore everything node us mutually exclusive callback group node essentially act handled single threaded executor even multi threaded one specified thus whenever one decides use multi threaded executor callback group always specified order executor choice make sense mind couple guideline help avoid deadlock make synchronous call type callback callback client making call need belong different callback group type reentrant callback group configuration possible due requirement thread safety blocking callback waiting result want make absolutely sure never

major version component despite regarding initial development subsequently package strive reach mature state increase version match semver specification caveat rule best effort unlikely extreme case may necessary break api within major version distribution whether unplanned break increment major minor version assessed case case basis example consider situation involving released x turtle corresponding major version released turtle corresponding major version api breaking fix identified absolutely necessary x turtle bumping obviously option already exists solution handling x turtle version case non ideal bumping x turtle minor version non ideal violates semver principle breaking change must bump major version bumping x turtle major version past turtle non ideal older distro version would become higher already available version newer distro would invalidate break version specific conditional code developer decide solution use importantly principle willing break suggest one either case require explicit measure taken communicate disruption explanation user manually beyond version increment turtle even though fix would technically patch x turtle would bump case adheres semver break rule major increment introduced released distribution consider versioning rule best effort unlikely example important accurately define versioning system public api declaration according semver every package must clearly declare public api use public api declaration section quality declaration package declare symbol part public api c c package declaration header installs however acceptable define set symbol considered private avoiding private symbol header help abi stability required language like python public api must explicitly defined clear symbol relied respect

process frontend client process core functionality gazebo sim client server communication various plugins load facilitate simulation plugins library loaded runtime allow gazebo sim utilize gazebo library many plugin type gazebo framework example plugins introduce new physic engine rendering engine however purpose document mention plugins referring gazebo sim server gui plugins loaded runtime gazebo need recompiled add remove plugins gazebo sim ship many plugins default server plugins gazebo gui plugins gazebo sim gui plugins optional removed user user also add plugins even write plugins compiled library file gazebo library modular plugins let gazebo sim utilize library example gazebo physic gazebo sim independent one another gazebo sim physic plugin us gazebo physic library incorporates gazebo specific allowing physic system running simulation loop gazebo physic library used physic plugin plugins core gazebo sim library used one plugin one process frontend backend however foundational library used plugins like gazebo common provides common functionality like logging manipulating string file system interaction etc plugins library include gazebo plugin gazebo math sdformat certain plugins frontend backend process loaded default every version gazebo many plugins optional one common optional plugin sensor plugin optional default plugins removed added time gazebo sim continue run limited functionality demo server configuration gui configuration showcase functionality simulation process depicted diagram explained backend frontend process section follow gazebo sim architecture diagram backend server process gazebo sim responsible loading plugins backend referred system server run entity component system architecture see gazebo sim terminology backend usually multiple system responsible everything simulation computing physic recording log receiving user command etc system act entity component entity entity anything simulation scene model link light actor etc component characteristic pose name geometry etc server plugins access entity component make modification component example user could write system applies force entity setting component entity physic system would pick react applying force make entity actually move modification entity component server plugins communicate entity component system self contained gazebo sim system act entity component since gazebo library direct knowledge access entity component gazebo library used system server plugin share entity component library example physic system share entity component gazebo physic library order achieve physic effect entity component loop running backend run system system proposing change entity component system handling applying change called simulation loop entity component manager ecm backend provides functionality actual querying updating entity component physic user command scene broadcaster system launched default backend mentioned earlier however even default system added removed simulation loop server configuration tutorial describes customize default system functionality like sensor data processing example additional system would loaded example need generate sensor data utilizes rendering sensor would need load sensor system visualization data however left client side plugins communication process information cross process boundary whether back front scene broadcaster front back user command go gazebo transport communication library synchronization process performed scene broadcaster server side gazebo sim plugin us gazebo transport gazebo message library send message server client message provided gazebo message framework creating publisher subscriber exchange message gazebo transport scene broadcaster system responsible getting state world entity component value ever changing simulation loop running back end packaging information compact message periodically sending frontend process omitting scene broadcaster possible would mean able visualize data frontend useful saving computational power addition state message sent scene broadcaster client client also make request server using user command system another backend plugin also utilizes gazebo transport gazebo message library user command system service requested frontend gui insert delete move etc model light entity send response back gui acknowledging receipt execution request several non default plugins able send receive message process outside server client process example server side sensor plugin publishes message outside server client process server side diff drive plugin receives info process client one process plugins may communicate example ros frontend client process client side process essentially gui also comprises multiple plugins loaded default others added optional frontend plugins use gazebo gui library client also relies gazebo gui visualization plugins create window gui add button interactive feature scene plugin utilizes gazebo rendering creates scene user see frontend plugins typically communicate among using event event similar message processed synchronously example render event emitted scene rendering thread right scene rendered give plugins chance execute code right thread moment valuable edit scene event emitted user right click hovers scene example frontend plugins access entity component information compressed message provided scene broadcaster system backend entity component manager client side performs actual message unpacking distributes entity component information
